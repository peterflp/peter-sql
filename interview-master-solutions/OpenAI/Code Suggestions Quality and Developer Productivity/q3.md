### Problem Statement

For April 2024, first concatenate the programming language and complexity level to form a unique identifier. Then, using the average of coding speed improvement and error reduction percentage as a combined metric, which concatenated combination shows the highest aggregated improvement? 

This final analysis directly informs efforts to achieve a targeted increase in developer productivity and error reduction.


### Tables

`fct_code_suggestions` - (suggestion_id: INTEGER, developer_id: INTEGER, programming_language: VARCHAR, complexity_level: VARCHAR, coding_speed_improvement: DECIMAL, error_reduction_percentage: DECIMAL, suggestion_date: DATE)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   CONCAT(programming_language, '-', complexity_level) as unique_identifier,
         (AVG(coding_speed_improvement) + AVG(error_reduction_percentage)) / 2 as average_combined_metric
FROM     fct_code_suggestions
WHERE    suggestion_date BETWEEN '2024-04-01' and '2024-04-30'
GROUP BY unique_identifier
ORDER BY average_combined_metric desc
LIMIT    1
```
