### Problem Statement

For each programming language in April 2024, what is the minimum error reduction percentage observed across all AI-driven code suggestions? 

This will help pinpoint languages where error reduction is lagging and may need targeted improvements.


### Tables

`fct_code_suggestions` - (suggestion_id: INTEGER, developer_id: INTEGER, programming_language: VARCHAR, complexity_level: VARCHAR, coding_speed_improvement: DECIMAL, error_reduction_percentage: DECIMAL, suggestion_date: DATE)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   programming_language, MIN(error_reduction_percentage) as min_error_reduction
FROM     fct_code_suggestions
WHERE    suggestion_date BETWEEN '2024-04-01' and '2024-04-30'
GROUP BY programming_language
```
