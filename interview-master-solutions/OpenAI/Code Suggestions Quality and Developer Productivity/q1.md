### Problem Statement

What is the average coding speed improvement percentage for each programming language using AI-driven code suggestions in April 2024? 

This analysis will help us determine if current suggestions are effectively boosting coding speed.


### Tables

`fct_code_suggestions` - (suggestion_id: INTEGER, developer_id: INTEGER, programming_language: VARCHAR, complexity_level: VARCHAR, coding_speed_improvement: DECIMAL, error_reduction_percentage: DECIMAL, suggestion_date: DATE)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   programming_language, AVG(coding_speed_improvement) as average_speed_improvement
FROM     fct_code_suggestions
WHERE    suggestion_date BETWEEN '2024-04-01' and '2024-04-30'
GROUP BY programming_language
```
