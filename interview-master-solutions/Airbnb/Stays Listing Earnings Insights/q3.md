### Problem Statement

Based on the top 50% of listings by earnings in July 2024, what percentage of these listings have ‘ocean view’ as an amenity?


### Tables

1. `dim_listings` - (listing_id: integer, amenities: text, location: text)

2. `fct_bookings` - (booking_id: integer, listing_id: integer, booking_date: date, nightly_price: decimal, cleaning_fee: decimal, booked_nights: integer)


### Solution Query

```sql
WITH listing_earnings as (
    SELECT   listing_id, 
             SUM((nightly_price + COALESCE(cleaning_fee, 0)) * booked_nights) as total_earnings
    FROM     fct_bookings
    WHERE    booking_date BETWEEN '2024-07-01' and '2024-07-31'
    GROUP BY listing_id
)
,ranked_listings as (
    SELECT listing_id, 
           total_earnings,
           RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_earnings desc) as rn
    FROM   listing_earnings
)
,top_listings as (
    SELECT listing_id 
    FROM   ranked_listings 
    WHERE  rn <= (SELECT COUNT(*) / 2 FROM ranked_listings)
)
SELECT ROUND(100 * 
                COUNT(CASE WHEN d.amenities LIKE '%ocean view%' THEN 1 END) /
                COUNT(*)
            , 2) as ocean_view_percentage
FROM   top_listings t JOIN dim_listings d ON t.listing_id = d.listing_id;
```
