### Problem Statement

For listings with no cleaning fee (ie. NULL values in the 'cleaning_fee' column), what is the average difference in nightly price compared to listings with a cleaning fee in July 2024?


### Tables

1. `dim_listings` - (listing_id: integer, amenities: text, location: text)

2. `fct_bookings` - (booking_id: integer, listing_id: integer, booking_date: date, nightly_price: decimal, cleaning_fee: decimal, booked_nights: integer)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT AVG(CASE WHEN cleaning_fee IS NOT NULL THEN nightly_price END) - 
       AVG(CASE WHEN cleaning_fee IS NULL THEN nightly_price END) as avg_price_difference
FROM   fct_bookings
WHERE  booking_date BETWEEN '2024-07-01' and '2024-07-31
```
