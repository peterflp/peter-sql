### Problem Statement

What is the overall average nightly price for listings with either a 'pool' or 'ocean view' in July 2024? Consider only listings that have been booked at least once during this period.


### Tables

1. `dim_listings` - (listing_id: integer, amenities: text, location: text)

2. `fct_bookings` - (booking_id: integer, listing_id: integer, booking_date: date, nightly_price: decimal, cleaning_fee: decimal, booked_nights: integer)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT AVG(b.nightly_price) as avg_nightly_price
FROM   fct_bookings b JOIN dim_listings l ON b.listing_id=l.listing_id
WHERE  b.booking_date BETWEEN '2024-07-01' and '2024-07-31'
       and (l.amenities LIKE '%pool%' OR l.amenities LIKE '%ocean view%')


-- ('pool' = ANY(STRING_TO_ARRAY(l.amenities, ', '))
-- or 'ocean view' = ANY(STRING_TO_ARRAY(l.amenities, ', ')))
```
