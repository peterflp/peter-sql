### Problem Statement

For bookings made in February 2024, what percentage of bookings were made more than 30 days in advance? Use this to recommend strategies for reducing booking costs.


### Tables

1. `dim_companies` - (company_id: integer, company_name: varchar)

2. `fct_corporate_bookings` - (booking_id: integer, company_id: integer, employee_id: integer, booking_cost: decimal, booking_date: date, travel_date: date)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT 100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER(WHERE travel_date - booking_date > 30) / COUNT(*) as percentage_advanced_bookings
FROM   fct_corporate_bookings
WHERE  booking_date BETWEEN '2024-02-01' and '2024-02-29'
```
