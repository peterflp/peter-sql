### Problem Statement

What is the average booking cost for corporate travelers? For this question, let's look only at trips which were booked in January 2024?


### Tables

1. `dim_companies` - (company_id: integer, company_name: varchar)

2. `fct_corporate_bookings` - (booking_id: integer, company_id: integer, employee_id: integer, booking_cost: decimal, booking_date: date, travel_date: date)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT AVG(booking_cost) as avg_booking_cost
FROM   fct_corporate_bookings
WHERE  booking_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' and '2024-01-31'
```
