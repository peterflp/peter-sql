### Problem Statement

Identify the top 5 companies with the highest average booking cost per employee for trips taken during the first quarter of 2024. 

Note that if an employee takes multiple trips, each booking will show up as a separate row in fct_corporate_bookings.


### Tables

1. `dim_companies` - (company_id: integer, company_name: varchar)

2. `fct_corporate_bookings` - (booking_id: integer, company_id: integer, employee_id: integer, booking_cost: decimal, booking_date: date, travel_date: date)


### Solution Query

```sql
WITH employee_avg_cost as (
    SELECT   company_id, employee_id, AVG(booking_cost) as avg_cost_per_employee
    FROM     fct_corporate_bookings
    WHERE    travel_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' and '2024-03-31'
    GROUP BY company_id, employee_id
)
SELECT   c.company_name, AVG(eac.avg_cost_per_employee) as avg_booking_cost
FROM     employee_avg_cost eac JOIN dim_companies c ON eac.company_id = c.company_id
GROUP BY c.company_name
ORDER BY avg_booking_cost desc
LIMIT    5
