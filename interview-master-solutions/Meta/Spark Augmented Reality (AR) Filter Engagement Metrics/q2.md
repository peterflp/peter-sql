### Problem Statement

How many total interactions did each AR filter receive in August 2024? Return only filter names that received over 1000 interactions, and their respective interaction counts.

### Tables

1. `ar_filters` (filter_id: INTEGER, filter_name: VARCHAR)

2. `ar_filter_engagements` (engagement_id: INTEGER, filter_id: INTEGER, interaction_count: INTEGER, engagement_date: DATE)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   f.filter_name, SUM(fe.interaction_count) as total_interactions
FROM     ar_filter_engagements fe JOIN ar_filters f ON fe.filter_id=f.filter_id
WHERE    engagement_date BETWEEN '2024-08-01' and '2024-08-31'
GROUP BY f.filter_name
HAVING   SUM(fe.interaction_count) > 1000
```
