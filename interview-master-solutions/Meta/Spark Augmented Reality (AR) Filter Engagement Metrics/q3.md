### Problem Statement

What are the top 3 AR filters with the highest number of interactions in September 2024, and how many interactions did each receive?


### Tables

1. `ar_filters` (filter_id: INTEGER, filter_name: VARCHAR)

2. `ar_filter_engagements` (engagement_id: INTEGER, filter_id: INTEGER, interaction_count: INTEGER, engagement_date: DATE)


### Solution Query

```sql
WITH ranked_filters as (
    SELECT   f.filter_name, 
             SUM(fe.interaction_count) as total_interactions,
             DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(fe.interaction_count) desc) as d_rn
    FROM     ar_filter_engagements fe JOIN ar_filters f ON fe.filter_id=f.filter_id
    WHERE    engagement_date BETWEEN '2024-09-01' and '2024-09-30'
    GROUP BY f.filter_name
)
SELECT filter_name, total_interactions
FROM   ranked_filters
WHERE  d_rn <= 3
```
