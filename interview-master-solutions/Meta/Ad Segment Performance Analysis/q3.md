### Problem Statement

For each custom audience or lookalike segment, calculate the cost per conversion. Only return this for segments that had non-zero spend and non-zero conversions.

`Cost per conversion` = `Total ad spend` / `Total number of conversions`



### Tables

1. `ad_performance` (ad_id: INTEGER, audience_segment_id: INTEGER, impressions: INTEGER, conversions: INTEGER, ad_spend: DECIMAL, date: DATE)

2. `audience_segments` (audience_segment_id: INTEGER, segment_name: VARCHAR)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   s.segment_name, SUM(ap.ad_spend) / SUM(ap.conversions) as cost_per_conversion
FROM     ad_performance as ap JOIN audience_segments as s ON ap.audience_segment_id = s.audience_segment_id
WHERE    ap.ad_spend > 0 
         and ap.conversions > 0
         and (s.segment_name LIKE 'Custom%' or s.segment_name LIKE 'Lookalike%')
GROUP BY s.segment_name
```
