### Problem Statement

How many total ad impressions did we receive from custom audience segments in October 2024?


### Tables

1. `ad_performance` (ad_id: INTEGER, audience_segment_id: INTEGER, impressions: INTEGER, conversions: INTEGER, ad_spend: DECIMAL, date: DATE)

2. `audience_segments` (audience_segment_id: INTEGER, segment_name: VARCHAR)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT SUM(ap.impressions) as total_ad_impressions
FROM   ad_performance ap JOIN audience_segments as s ON ap.audience_segment_id=s.audience_segment_id
WHERE  ap.date BETWEEN '2024-10-01' and '2024-10-31'
       and segment_name LIKE 'Custom Audience%'



-- NOTE: didn't realize/include the custom audience part initially.
