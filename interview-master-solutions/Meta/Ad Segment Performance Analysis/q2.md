### Problem Statement

What is the total number of conversions we achieved from each custom audience segment in October 2024?


### Tables

1. `ad_performance` (ad_id: INTEGER, audience_segment_id: INTEGER, impressions: INTEGER, conversions: INTEGER, ad_spend: DECIMAL, date: DATE)

2. `audience_segments` (audience_segment_id: INTEGER, segment_name: VARCHAR)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   s.segment_name, SUM(ap.conversions) as total_conversions
FROM     ad_performance as ap JOIN audience_segments as s ON ap.audience_segment_id=s.audience_segment_id
WHERE    ap.date BETWEEN '2024-10-01' and '2024-10-31'
         and s.segment_name LIKE 'Custom Audience%'
GROUP BY s.segment_name
```
