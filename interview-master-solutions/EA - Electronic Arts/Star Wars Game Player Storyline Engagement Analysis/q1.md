### Problem Statement

For each storyline component, how many unique players interacted with that component during the entire month of May 2024? 

If a storyline component did not have any interactions, return the component name with the player count of 0.


### Tables

1. `dim_storyline_components` - (storyline_component_id: INTEGER, component_name: VARCHAR)

2. `fct_storyline_interactions` - (interaction_id: INTEGER, player_id: INTEGER, storyline_component_id: INTEGER, interaction_date: DATE)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   c.component_name, COALESCE(COUNT(distinct i.player_id), 0) as num_players
FROM     dim_storyline_components c LEFT JOIN fct_storyline_interactions i
ON       i.storyline_component_id=c.storyline_component_id
         and i.interaction_date BETWEEN '2024-05-01' and '2024-05-31'
GROUP BY c.component_name


-- NOTE: 

-- earlier was using the date condition in the WHERE clause. 

-- issue: The WHERE clause on i.interaction_date is filtering out NULLs from the left join â€” which means storyline components with no interactions at all will not appear in the result, even though you're using a LEFT JOIN.
