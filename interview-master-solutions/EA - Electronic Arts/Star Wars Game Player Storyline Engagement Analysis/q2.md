### Problem Statement

What is the total number of storyline interactions for each storyline component and player combination during May 2024? Consider only those players who have interacted with at least two different storyline components.


### Tables

1. `dim_storyline_components` - (storyline_component_id: INTEGER, component_name: VARCHAR)

2. `fct_storyline_interactions` - (interaction_id: INTEGER, player_id: INTEGER, storyline_component_id: INTEGER, interaction_date: DATE)


### Solution Query

```sql
WITH may_interactions as (
    SELECT *
    FROM   fct_storyline_interactions
    WHERE  interaction_date BETWEEN '2024-05-01' and '2024-05-31'
)
,qualified_players as (
    SELECT   player_id
    FROM     may_interactions
    GROUP BY player_id
    HAVING   COUNT(DISTINCT storyline_component_id) >= 2
)
SELECT   mi.player_id,
         dsc.component_name,
         COUNT(*) as total_interactions
FROM     may_interactions mi JOIN qualified_players qp ON mi.player_id = qp.player_id
                             JOIN dim_storyline_components dsc ON mi.storyline_component_id = dsc.storyline_component_id
GROUP BY mi.player_id, dsc.component_name
ORDER BY mi.player_id, dsc.component_name
```
