### Problem Statement

Can you rank the storyline components by the average number of interactions per player during May 2024? Provide list of storyline component names and their ranking.


### Tables

1. `dim_storyline_components` - (storyline_component_id: INTEGER, component_name: VARCHAR)

2. `fct_storyline_interactions` - (interaction_id: INTEGER, player_id: INTEGER, storyline_component_id: INTEGER, interaction_date: DATE)


### Solution Query

```sql
WITH component_stats as (
    SELECT   storyline_component_id,
             COUNT(*) as total_interactions,
             COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) as unique_players,
             1.0 * COUNT(*) / COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) as avg_interactions_per_player
    FROM     fct_storyline_interactions
    WHERE    interaction_date BETWEEN '2024-05-01' and '2024-05-31'
    GROUP BY storyline_component_id
)
SELECT c.component_name,
       cs.avg_interactions_per_player,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY cs.avg_interactions_per_player DESC) as ranking
FROM   component_stats cs JOIN dim_storyline_components c 
ON     cs.storyline_component_id = c.storyline_component_id;
```
