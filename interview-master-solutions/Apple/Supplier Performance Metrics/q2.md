### Problem Statement

For each region, find the supplier that delivered the highest number of components in November 2024. This will help us understand which supplier is handling the most volume per market.


### Tables

1. `suppliers` - (supplier_id: INTEGER, supplier_name: VARCHAR)

2. `supplier_deliveries` - (supplier_id: INTEGER, delivery_date: DATE, component_count: INTEGER, manufacturing_region: VARCHAR)


### Solution Query

```sql
WITH get_totals as (
    SELECT   manufacturing_region, 
             supplier_id, 
             SUM(component_count) as num_components
    FROM     supplier_deliveries
    WHERE    delivery_date BETWEEN '2024-11-01' AND '2024-11-30'
    GROUP BY manufacturing_region, supplier_id
)
, ranked_suppliers as (
    SELECT manufacturing_region,
           supplier_id,
           num_components,
           RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY manufacturing_region ORDER BY num_components desc) as rn
    FROM   get_totals
)
SELECT manufacturing_region, supplier_id, num_components
FROM   ranked_suppliers
WHERE  rn=1
```
