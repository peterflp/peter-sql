### Problem Statement

We need to know who our most active suppliers are. Identify the top 5 suppliers based on the total volume of components delivered in October 2024.


### Tables

1. `suppliers` - (supplier_id: INTEGER, supplier_name: VARCHAR)

2. `supplier_deliveries` - (supplier_id: INTEGER, delivery_date: DATE, component_count: INTEGER, manufacturing_region: VARCHAR)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   sd.supplier_name, SUM(sd.component_count) as total_components_delivered
FROM     suppliers s JOIN supplier_deliveries sd ON s.supplier_id=sd.supplier_id
WHERE    sd.delivery_date BETWEEN '2024-10-01' and '2024-10-31'
GROUP BY sd.supplier_name
ORDER BY total_components_delivered desc
LIMIT    5
```
