### Problem Statement

We need to identify potential gaps in our supply chain for Asia. List all suppliers by name who have not delivered any components to the 'Asia' manufacturing region in December 2024.


### Tables

1. `suppliers` - (supplier_id: INTEGER, supplier_name: VARCHAR)

2. `supplier_deliveries` - (supplier_id: INTEGER, delivery_date: DATE, component_count: INTEGER, manufacturing_region: VARCHAR)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT s.supplier_name
FROM   suppliers s LEFT JOIN supplier_deliveries sd 
ON     s.supplier_id=sd.supplier_id
       and sd.manufacturing_region = 'Asia'
       and sd.delivery_date BETWEEN '2024-12-01' and '2024-12-31'
WHERE  sd.supplier_id IS NULL



-- Note on WHERE vs. JOIN Conditions :-

-- Placing filter conditions in the WHERE clause (e.g., sd.manufacturing_region = 'Asia') after a LEFT JOIN removes NULL values and effectively turns it into an INNER JOIN, excluding suppliers with no matching deliveries.

-- Placing conditions inside the ON clause ensures that all suppliers remain in the result, and we can then filter for those with NULL values in supplier_deliveries, correctly identifying suppliers who never delivered to Asia in December 2024.
