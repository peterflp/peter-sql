### Problem Statement

As a Product Analyst on the Mac software team, you are investigating exceptional daily usage patterns in September 2024. For each day, determine the distinct user count and the total hours spent using multimedia tools. 

Which days have both metrics above the respective average daily values for September 2024?


### Tables

`fct_multimedia_usage` - (user_id: integer, usage_date: date, hours_spent: decimal)


### Solution Query

```sql
WITH daily_usage as (
  SELECT   usage_date,
           COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as num_users,
           SUM(hours_spent) as total_time_spent
  FROM     fct_multimedia_usage
  WHERE    usage_date BETWEEN '2024-09-01' and '2024-09-30'
  GROUP BY usage_date
)
, avg_metrics as (
  SELECT AVG(num_users) as avg_user_count, AVG(total_time_spent) as avg_hours_spent
  FROM   daily_usage
)
SELECT d.usage_date, d.num_users, d.total_time_spent, a.avg_user_count, a.avg_hours_spent
FROM   daily_usage d JOIN avg_metrics a ON 1=1
WHERE  d.num_users > a.avg_user_count
       and d.total_time_spent > a.avg_hours_spent
```
