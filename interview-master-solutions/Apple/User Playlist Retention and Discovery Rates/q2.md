### Problem Statement

Among the users who added recommended tracks in October 2024, what is the average number of recommended tracks added to their playlists? Please round this to 1 decimal place for better readability.


### Tables

1. `users` - (user_id: INTEGER, user_name: VARCHAR)

2. `tracks_added` - (interaction_id: INTEGER, user_id: INTEGER, track_id: INTEGER, added_date: DATE, is_recommended: BOOLEAN)


### Solution Query

```sql
WITH cte as (
    SELECT   u.user_id, COUNT(distinct ta.track_id) as tracks_count
    FROM     users u JOIN tracks_added ta ON u.user_id=ta.user_id
    WHERE    added_date BETWEEN '2024-10-01' and '2024-10-31'
             and is_recommended=1
    GROUP BY u.user_id
)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(tracks_count), 1) as rounded_avg_tracks_added
FROM   cte
```
