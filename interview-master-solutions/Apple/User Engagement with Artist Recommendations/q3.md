### Problem Statement

Across users who listened to at least one recommended artist, what is the average number of distinct recommended artists they listened to? 

As in the previous question, only include streams that occurred on or after the date the artist was recommended to the user.


### Tables

1. `user_streams` - (stream_id: INTEGER, user_id: INTEGER, artist_id: INTEGER, stream_date: DATE)

2. `artist_recommendations` - (recommendation_id: INTEGER, user_id: INTEGER, artist_id: INTEGER, recommendation_date: DATE)


### Solution Query

```sql
WITH cte as (
    SELECT   us.user_id, COUNT(distinct us.artist_id) as distinct_artists
    FROM     user_streams us JOIN artist_recommendations ar USING(user_id, artist_id)
    WHERE    us.stream_date >= ar.recommendation_date
    GROUP BY us.user_id
)
SELECT AVG(distinct_artists) as avg_artists_per_user
FROM   cte
```
