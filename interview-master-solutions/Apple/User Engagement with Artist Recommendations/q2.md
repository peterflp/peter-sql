### Problem Statement

What is the average number of times a recommended artist is streamed by users in May 2024? Similar to the previous question, only include streams on or after the date the artist was recommended to them.


### Tables

1. `user_streams` - (stream_id: INTEGER, user_id: INTEGER, artist_id: INTEGER, stream_date: DATE)

2. `artist_recommendations` - (recommendation_id: INTEGER, user_id: INTEGER, artist_id: INTEGER, recommendation_date: DATE)


### Solution Query

```sql
WITH valid_streams as (
    SELECT   us.user_id, us.artist_id, COUNT(*) as stream_count
    FROM     user_streams us JOIN artist_recommendations ar USING(user_id, artist_id)
    WHERE    us.stream_date BETWEEN '2024-05-01' AND '2024-05-31'
             and us.stream_date >= ar.recommendation_date
    GROUP BY us.user_id, us.artist_id
)
SELECT AVG(stream_count) as average_streams_per_artist
FROM   valid_streams
```
