### Problem Statement

How many unique users have streamed an artist on or after the date it was recommended to them?


### Tables

1. `user_streams` - (stream_id: INTEGER, user_id: INTEGER, artist_id: INTEGER, stream_date: DATE)

2. `artist_recommendations` - (recommendation_id: INTEGER, user_id: INTEGER, artist_id: INTEGER, recommendation_date: DATE)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT COUNT(distinct us.user_id) as unique_users
FROM   user_streams us JOIN artist_recommendations ar USING(user_id, artist_id)
WHERE  us.stream_date >= ar.recommendation_date
```
