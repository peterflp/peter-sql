### Problem Statement

Determine the average marketing spend per new subscriber for each country in Q1 2024 by rounding up to the nearest whole number to evaluate campaign efficiency.


### Tables

1. `dimension_country` (country_id: int, country_name: varchar)

2. `fact_marketing_spend` (spend_id: int, country_id: int, campaign_date: date, amount_spent: decimal)

3. `fact_daily_subscriptions` (subscription_id: int, country_id: int, signup_date: date, num_new_subscribers: int)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   c.country_name,
         CEIL(SUM(ms.amount_spent) / NULLIF(SUM(s.num_new_subscribers), 0)) as avg_spend_per_subscriber
FROM     fact_marketing_spend ms JOIN fact_daily_subscriptions s ON ms.country_id = s.country_id
                                 JOIN dimension_country c ON ms.country_id=c.country_id
WHERE    ms.campaign_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' and '2024-03-31'
         and s.signup_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' and '2024-03-31'
GROUP BY c.country_name
```
