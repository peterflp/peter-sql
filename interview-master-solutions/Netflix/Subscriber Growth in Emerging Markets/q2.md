### Problem Statement

List the number of new subscribers acquired in each country (with name) during January 2024, renaming the subscriber count column to 'new_subscribers' for clearer reporting purposes.


### Tables

1. `dimension_country` (country_id: int, country_name: varchar)

2. `fact_marketing_spend` (spend_id: int, country_id: int, campaign_date: date, amount_spent: decimal)

3. `fact_daily_subscriptions` (subscription_id: int, country_id: int, signup_date: date, num_new_subscribers: int)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   c.country_name, SUM(ds.num_new_subscribers) as new_subscribers
FROM     fact_daily_subscriptions ds JOIN dimension_country c ON ds.country_id=c.country_id
WHERE    ds.signup_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' and '2024-01-31'
GROUP BY c.country_name
```
