### Problem Statement

We are interested in understanding the engagement level of playlists. Specifically, we want to identify which playlist has the lowest average listening time per track. 

This means calculating the total listening time for each playlist in October 2024 and then normalizing it by the number of tracks in that playlist. 

Can you provide the name of the playlist with the lowest value based on this calculation?



### Tables

1. `playlists` (playlist_id: INTEGER, playlist_name: VARCHAR, number_of_tracks: INTEGER)

2. `playlist_engagement` (playlist_id: INTEGER, user_id: INTEGER, listening_time_minutes: FLOAT, engagement_date: DATE)


### Solution Query

```sql
WITH get_total_time as (
    SELECT   p.*, SUM(pe.listening_time_minutes) as total_listening_time
    FROM     playlists p JOIN playlist_engagement pe ON p.playlist_id=pe.playlist_id
    WHERE    pe.engagement_date BETWEEN '2024-10-01' and '2024-10-31'
    GROUP BY p.playlist_id, p.playlist_name, p.number_of_tracks
)
,ranked_playlists as (
    SELECT playlist_id, 
           playlist_name, 
           (total_listening_time / NULLIF(number_of_tracks, 0)) as avg_listening_time_per_track, 
           DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY (total_listening_time / NULLIF(number_of_tracks, 0))) as d_rn
    FROM   get_total_time
)
SELECT playlist_id, playlist_name, avg_listening_time_per_track
FROM   ranked_playlists
WHERE  d_rn=1
```
