### Problem Statement

To optimize our recommendations, we need the average monthly listening time per listener for each playlist in October 2024. For readibility, please round down to the average listening time to the nearest whole number.


### Tables

1. `playlists` (playlist_id: INTEGER, playlist_name: VARCHAR, number_of_tracks: INTEGER)

2. `playlist_engagement` (playlist_id: INTEGER, user_id: INTEGER, listening_time_minutes: FLOAT, engagement_date: DATE)


### Solution Query

```sql
WITH cte as (
    SELECT   user_id, playlist_id, SUM(listening_time_minutes) as total_listening_time
    FROM     playlist_engagement 
    WHERE    engagement_date BETWEEN '2024-10-01' and '2024-10-31'
    GROUP BY user_id, playlist_id
)
SELECT   playlist_id, ROUND(AVG(total_listening_time)) as avg_listening_time
FROM     cte
GROUP BY playlist_id
```
