### Problem Statement

The Amazon Music Recommendation Team wants to know which playlists have the least number of tracks. Can you find out the playlist with the minimum number of tracks?


### Tables

1. `playlists` (playlist_id: INTEGER, playlist_name: VARCHAR, number_of_tracks: INTEGER)

2. `playlist_engagement` (playlist_id: INTEGER, user_id: INTEGER, listening_time_minutes: FLOAT, engagement_date: DATE)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT *
FROM   playlists
WHERE  number_of_tracks = (SELECT MIN(number_of_tracks) FROM playlists)
```
