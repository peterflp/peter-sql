### Problem Statement

The team also wants to label the usage of each device category into 'Low' or 'High' based on usage duration from July 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024. If the total usage time was less than 300 minutes, we'll category it as 'Low'. Otherwise, we'll categorize it as 'high'.


### Tables

1. `dim_device` - (device_id: INT, device_name: VARCHAR)

2. `dim_device` - (device_id: INT, device_name: VARCHAR)

3. `fct_device_usage` - (usage_id: INT, device_id: INT, service_id: INT, usage_duration_minutes: INT, usage_date: DATE)


### Solution Query

```sql
WITH total_usage_per_device as (
    SELECT   device_id, SUM(usage_duration_minutes) as total_usage_duration
    FROM     fct_device_usage
    WHERE    usage_date BETWEEN '2024-07-01' AND '2024-09-30'
    GROUP BY device_id
)
SELECT   CASE WHEN total_usage_duration < 300 THEN 'Low' ELSE 'High' END as usage_category,
         COUNT(*) as usage_count
FROM     total_usage_per_device
GROUP BY usage_category
```
