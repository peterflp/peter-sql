### Problem Statement

The team is considering bundling the Prime Video and Amazon Music subscription. They want to understand what percentage of total usage time comes from Prime Video and Amazon Music services respectively. Please use data from July 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024.


### Tables

1. `dim_device` - (device_id: INT, device_name: VARCHAR)

2. `dim_device` - (device_id: INT, device_name: VARCHAR)

3. `fct_device_usage` - (usage_id: INT, device_id: INT, service_id: INT, usage_duration_minutes: INT, usage_date: DATE)


### Solution Query

```sql
WITH cte as (
    SELECT SUM(usage_duration_minutes) as total_usage
    FROM   fct_device_usage
    WHERE  usage_date BETWEEN '2024-07-01' AND '2024-09-30'
)
SELECT   ds.service_id, 100.0 * SUM(du.usage_duration_minutes) / c.total_usage as pc_minutes
FROM     fct_device_usage du JOIN dim_service ds ON du.service_id=ds.service_id
                             JOIN cte c
WHERE    du.usage_date BETWEEN '2024-07-01' and '2024-09-30'
         and ds.service_name IN ('Prime Video', 'Amazon Music')
GROUP BY ds.service_id
```
