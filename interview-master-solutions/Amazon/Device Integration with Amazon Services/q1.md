### Problem Statement

The team wants to identify the total usage duration of the services for each device type by extracting the primary device category from the device name for the period from July 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024. 

The primary device category is derived from the first word of the device name.


### Tables

1. `dim_device` - (device_id: INT, device_name: VARCHAR)

2. `dim_device` - (device_id: INT, device_name: VARCHAR)

3. `fct_device_usage` - (usage_id: INT, device_id: INT, service_id: INT, usage_duration_minutes: INT, usage_date: DATE)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   SUBSTR(dd.device_name, 1, INSTR(dd.device_name, ' ') - 1) as device_category, 
         SUM(du.usage_duration_minutes) as total_usage_duration
FROM     fct_device_usage du JOIN dim_device dd ON du.device_id=dd.device_id
WHERE    du.usage_date BETWEEN '2024-07-01' and '2024-09-30'
GROUP BY device_category
```
