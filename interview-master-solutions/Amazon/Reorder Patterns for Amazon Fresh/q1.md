### Problem Statement

The product team wants to analyze the most frequently reordered product categories. Can you provide a list of the product category codes (using first 3 letters of product code) and their reorder counts for Q4 2024?


### Tables

1. `fct_orders` - (order_id: int, customer_id: int, product_id: int, reorder_flag: boolean, order_date: date)

2. `dim_products` - (product_id: int, product_code: varchar, category: varchar)

3. `dim_customers` - (customer_id: int, customer_name: varchar)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   SUBSTR(p.product_code, 1, 3) as product_category_code, 
         SUM(o.reorder_flag) as reorder_counts
FROM     dim_products p JOIN fct_orders o ON p.product_id=o.product_id
WHERE    o.order_date BETWEEN '2024-10-01' and '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY product_category_code
```
