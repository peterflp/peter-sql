### Problem Statement

To better understand customer preferences, the team needs to know the details of customers who reorder specific products. Can you retrieve the customer information along with their reordered product code(s) for Q4 2024?


### Tables

1. `fct_orders` - (order_id: int, customer_id: int, product_id: int, reorder_flag: boolean, order_date: date)

2. `dim_products` - (product_id: int, product_code: varchar, category: varchar)

3. `dim_customers` - (customer_id: int, customer_name: varchar)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   c.customer_id, c.customer_name, p.product_code
FROM     dim_products p JOIN fct_orders o ON p.product_id=o.product_id
                        JOIN dim_customers c ON o.customer_id=c.customer_id
WHERE    o.order_date BETWEEN '2024-10-01' and '2024-12-31'
         and o.reorder_flag=1
```
