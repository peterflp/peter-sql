### Problem Statement

When calculating the average reorder frequency, it's important to handle cases where reorder counts may be missing or zero. Can you compute the average reorder frequency across the product categories, ensuring that any missing or null values are appropriately managed for Q4 2024?


### Tables

1. `fct_orders` - (order_id: int, customer_id: int, product_id: int, reorder_flag: boolean, order_date: date)

2. `dim_products` - (product_id: int, product_code: varchar, category: varchar)

3. `dim_customers` - (customer_id: int, customer_name: varchar)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   p.category, AVG(COALESCE(o.reorder_flag, 0)) as avg_reorder_frequency
FROM     dim_products p JOIN fct_orders o ON p.product_id=o.product_id
WHERE    o.order_date BETWEEN '2024-10-01' and '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY p.category
```
