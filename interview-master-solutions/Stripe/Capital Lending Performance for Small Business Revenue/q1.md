### Problem Statement

What is the average monthly revenue for small businesses that received a loan versus those that did not receive a loan during January 2024? Use the `business_size` field to filter for small businesses.


### Tables

1. `fct_loans` - (loan_id: integer, business_id: integer, loan_amount: decimal, loan_issued_date: date, loan_repaid: boolean)

2. `dim_businesses` - (business_id: integer, monthly_revenue: decimal, revenue_variability: decimal, business_size: varchar)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   CASE WHEN fl.loan_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'Received Loan' ELSE 'Did Not Receive Loan' END as loan_status, 
         AVG(db.monthly_revenue) as average_monthly_revenue
FROM     dim_businesses db LEFT JOIN fct_loans fl 
ON       fl.business_id=db.business_id
         and fl.loan_issued_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' and '2024-01-31'
WHERE    db.business_size='small'
GROUP BY loan_status
```
