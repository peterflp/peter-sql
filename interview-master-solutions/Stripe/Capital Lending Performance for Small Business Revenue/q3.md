### Problem Statement

For small businesses during January 2024, what is the loan repayment success rate for each revenue variability category? 

Order the results from the highest to the lowest success rate to assess the correlation between revenue variability and repayment reliability.


### Tables

1. `fct_loans` - (loan_id: integer, business_id: integer, loan_amount: decimal, loan_issued_date: date, loan_repaid: boolean)

2. `dim_businesses` - (business_id: integer, monthly_revenue: decimal, revenue_variability: decimal, business_size: varchar)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   CASE 
              WHEN db.revenue_variability < 0.1 THEN 'Low'
              WHEN db.revenue_variability BETWEEN 0.1 and 0.3 THEN 'Medium'
              ELSE 'High'
         END as variability_category,
         ROUND(100.0 * SUM(loan_repaid) / COUNT(*),  2) as repayment_success_rate
FROM     dim_businesses db JOIN fct_loans fl 
ON       db.business_id = fl.business_id
         and fl.loan_issued_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' and '2024-01-31'
WHERE    db.business_size = 'small'
GROUP BY variability_category
ORDER BY repayment_success_rate desc
```
