### Problem Statement

For small businesses that received a loan in January 2024, what percentage of businesses successfully repaid their loans? Categorize these businesses into low, medium, and high revenue variability groups using these values

- Low: <0.1
- Medium: 0.1 - 0.3
- High: >0.3


### Tables

1. `fct_loans` - (loan_id: integer, business_id: integer, loan_amount: decimal, loan_issued_date: date, loan_repaid: boolean)

2. `dim_businesses` - (business_id: integer, monthly_revenue: decimal, revenue_variability: decimal, business_size: varchar)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   CASE 
              WHEN db.revenue_variability < 0.1 THEN 'Low'
              WHEN db.revenue_variability BETWEEN 0.1 and 0.3 THEN 'Medium'
              ELSE 'High'
         END as variability_category,
         ROUND(100.0 * SUM(loan_repaid) / COUNT(*),  2) as repayment_success_rate
FROM     dim_businesses db JOIN fct_loans fl 
ON       db.business_id = fl.business_id
         and fl.loan_issued_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' and '2024-01-31'
WHERE    db.business_size = 'small'
GROUP BY variability_category
```
