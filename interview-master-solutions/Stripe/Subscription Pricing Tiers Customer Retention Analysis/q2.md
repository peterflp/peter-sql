### Problem Statement

Using subscriptions that started in Q3 2024, for each pricing tier, what percentage of customers renewed their subscription? 

Customers who have renewed their subscription would have a renewal status of 'Renewed'. This breakdown will help assess retention effectiveness across tiers.


### Tables

`fct_subscriptions` - (subscription_id: integer, customer_id: integer, pricing_tier: string, start_date: date, end_date: date, renewal_status: string)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   pricing_tier, 
         100.0 * COUNT(customer_id) FILTER(WHERE renewal_status='Renewed') / COUNT(*) as renewal_percentage
FROM     fct_subscriptions
WHERE    start_date BETWEEN '2024-07-01' and '2024-09-30'
GROUP BY pricing_tier
```
