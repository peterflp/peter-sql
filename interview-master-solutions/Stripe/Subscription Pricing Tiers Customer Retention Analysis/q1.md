### Problem Statement

For Quarter 3 of 2024, what is the total number of distinct customers who started a subscription for each pricing tier? This query establishes baseline subscription counts for evaluating customer retention.


### Tables

`fct_subscriptions` - (subscription_id: integer, customer_id: integer, pricing_tier: string, start_date: date, end_date: date, renewal_status: string)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   pricing_tier, COUNT(distinct customer_id) as distinct_customers
FROM     fct_subscriptions
WHERE    start_date BETWEEN '2024-07-01' and '2024-09-30'
GROUP BY pricing_tier
```
