### Problem Statement

Based on subscriptions that started in Quarter 3 of 2024, rank the pricing tiers by their retention rate. Weâ€™d like to see both the retention rate and the rank for each tier, so we can identify which pricing model keeps customers engaged the longest.


### Tables

`fct_subscriptions` - (subscription_id: integer, customer_id: integer, pricing_tier: string, start_date: date, end_date: date, renewal_status: string)


### Solution Query

```sql
WITH cte as (
    SELECT   pricing_tier, 
             100.0 * COUNT(customer_id) FILTER(WHERE renewal_status='Renewed') / COUNT(*) as retention_rate
    FROM     fct_subscriptions
    WHERE    start_date BETWEEN '2024-07-01' and '2024-09-30'
    GROUP BY pricing_tier 
)
SELECT pricing_tier, retention_rate, RANK() OVER(ORDER BY retention_rate desc) as rank_value
FROM   cte
```
