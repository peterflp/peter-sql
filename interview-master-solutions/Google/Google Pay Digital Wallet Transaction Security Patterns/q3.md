### Problem Statement

From January 1st to March 31st, 2024, can you generate a list of merchant categories with their concatenated counts for successful and failed transactions? 

Then, rank the categories by total transaction volume. This ranking will support our assessment of areas where mixed transaction outcomes may affect user experience.


### Tables

`fct_transactions` - (transaction_id, merchant_category, transaction_status, transaction_date)


### Solution Query

```sql
WITH cte as (
    SELECT   merchant_category, 
             COUNT(transaction_id) FILTER(WHERE transaction_status='SUCCESS') as total_success,
             COUNT(transaction_id) FILTER(WHERE transaction_status='FAILED') as total_failed
    FROM     fct_transactions
    WHERE    transaction_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' and '2024-03-31'
    GROUP BY merchant_category
)
SELECT merchant_category, 
       CONCAT(total_success, ' | ', total_failed) as concatenated_cts, 
       (total_success + total_failed) as total_volume,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY (total_success + total_failed) desc) as rank
FROM   cte
```
