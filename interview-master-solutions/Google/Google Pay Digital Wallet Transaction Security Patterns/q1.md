### Problem Statement

For January 2024, what are the total counts of successful and failed transactions in each merchant category? This analysis will help the Google Pay security team identify potential friction points in payment processing.


### Tables

`fct_transactions` - (transaction_id, merchant_category, transaction_status, transaction_date)


### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   merchant_category, 
         COUNT(transaction_id) FILTER(WHERE transaction_status='SUCCESS') as total_success,
         COUNT(transaction_id) FILTER(WHERE transaction_status='FAILED') as total_failed
FROM     fct_transactions
WHERE    transaction_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' and '2024-01-31'
GROUP BY merchant_category
```
