### Problem Statement

For the first quarter of 2024, which merchant categories recorded a transaction success rate below 90%? This insight will guide our prioritization of security enhancements to improve payment reliability.


### Tables

`fct_transactions` - (transaction_id, merchant_category, transaction_status, transaction_date)


### Solution Query

```sql
WITH cte as (
    SELECT   merchant_category, 
             1.0 * COUNT(transaction_id) FILTER(WHERE transaction_status='SUCCESS') / COUNT(*) as success_rate
    FROM     fct_transactions
    WHERE    transaction_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' and '2024-03-31'
    GROUP BY merchant_category 
)
SELECT *
FROM   cte
WHERE  success_rate < 0.9
```
