### Problem Statement

The team wants to compare conversion rates between free and premium apps across all categories. Combine the conversion data for both app types to present a unified view for Q4 2024.


### Tables

1. `dim_app` - (app_id: INT, app_name: VARCHAR, category: VARCHAR, app_type: VARCHAR)

2. `fct_app_browsing` - (app_id: INT, browse_date: DATE, browse_count: INT)

3. `fct_app_browsing` - (app_id: INT, browse_date: DATE, browse_count: INT)



### Solution Query

```sql
WITH browsing_q4 as (
    SELECT   d.category, d.app_type, SUM(fb.browse_count) as total_browse_count
    FROM     fct_app_browsing fb JOIN dim_app d ON fb.app_id = d.app_id
    WHERE    fb.browse_date BETWEEN '2024-10-01' and '2024-12-31'
    GROUP BY d.category, d.app_type
)
,downloads_q4 as (
    SELECT   d.category, d.app_type, SUM(fd.download_count) as total_download_count
    FROM     fct_app_downloads fd JOIN dim_app d ON fd.app_id = d.app_id
    WHERE    fd.download_date BETWEEN '2024-10-01' and '2024-12-31'
    GROUP BY d.category, d.app_type
)

SELECT b.category, 
       b.app_type, 
       COALESCE(1.0 * d.total_download_count, 0) / b.total_browse_count as download_conversion_rate
FROM   browsing_q4 b LEFT JOIN downloads_q4 d USING(category, app_type)
WHERE  b.total_browse_count > 0
