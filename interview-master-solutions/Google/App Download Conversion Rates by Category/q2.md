### Problem Statement

Our team's goal is download conversion rate -- defined as downloads per browse event. 

For each app category, calculate the download conversion rate in December, removing categories where browsing counts are be zero.


### Tables

1. `dim_app` - (app_id: INT, app_name: VARCHAR, category: VARCHAR, app_type: VARCHAR)

2. `fct_app_browsing` - (app_id: INT, browse_date: DATE, browse_count: INT)

3. `fct_app_browsing` - (app_id: INT, browse_date: DATE, browse_count: INT)



### Solution Query

```sql
WITH browsing_december as (
    SELECT   d.category, SUM(fb.browse_count) as total_browse_count
    FROM     fct_app_browsing fb JOIN dim_app d ON fb.app_id = d.app_id
    WHERE    fb.browse_date BETWEEN '2024-12-01' and '2024-12-31'
    GROUP BY d.category
)
,downloads_december as (
    SELECT   d.category, SUM(fd.download_count) as total_download_count
    FROM     fct_app_downloads fd JOIN dim_app d ON fd.app_id = d.app_id
    WHERE    fd.download_date BETWEEN '2024-12-01' and '2024-12-31'
    GROUP BY d.category
)

SELECT b.category, COALESCE(1.0 * d.total_download_count, 0) / b.total_browse_count as download_conversion_rate
FROM   browsing_december b LEFT JOIN downloads_december d ON b.category = d.category
WHERE  b.total_browse_count > 0



-- my first attempt (wasn't workingfor some reason):


-- WITH cte as (
--     SELECT   d.category,
--              SUM(fb.browse_count) as total_browse_count,
--              SUM(fd.download_count) as total_download_count
--     FROM     fct_app_browsing fb JOIN fct_app_downloads fd ON fb.app_id = fd.app_id
--                                  JOIN dim_app d ON d.app_id=fd.app_id
--     WHERE    fb.browse_date BETWEEN '2024-12-01' and '2024-12-31'
--              and fd.download_date BETWEEN '2024-12-01' and '2024-12-31'
--     GROUP BY d.category
-- )
-- SELECT   category, COALESCE(total_download_count, 0) * 1.0 / total_browse_count as download_conversion_rate
-- FROM     cte
-- WHERE    total_browse_count > 0
