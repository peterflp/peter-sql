### Problem Statement

The marketplace team wants to identify high and low performing app categories. Provide the total downloads for the app categories for November 2024. If there were no downloads for that category, return the value as 0.


### Tables

1. `dim_app` - (app_id: INT, app_name: VARCHAR, category: VARCHAR, app_type: VARCHAR)

2. `fct_app_browsing` - (app_id: INT, browse_date: DATE, browse_count: INT)

3. `fct_app_browsing` - (app_id: INT, browse_date: DATE, browse_count: INT)



### Solution Query

```sql
SELECT   da.category, COALESCE(SUM(download_count), 0) as num_downloads
FROM     dim_app da LEFT JOIN fct_app_downloads do 
ON       da.app_id=do.app_id
         and do.download_date BETWEEN '2024-11-01' and '2024-11-30'
GROUP BY da.category
```
