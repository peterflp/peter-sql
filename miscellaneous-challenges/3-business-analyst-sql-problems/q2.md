## Advertising System Deviations Report

### Problem Statement 


As part of HackerAd's advertising system analytics, they need a list of the customers who have the most failures and successes in ad campaigns.

There should be exactly two rows that contain type, customer, campaign, total.


- `type` contains 'success' in the first row and 'failure' in the second. These relate to events.status.

- `customer` is the customers.first_name and customers.last_name, separated by a single space.

- `campaign` is a comma-separated list of campaigns.name that are associated with the customer, ordered ascending.

- `total` is the number of associated events.

Report only 2 customers, the two with the most successful and the most failing campaigns.


### Schema setup 

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id          INT,
    first_name  VARCHAR(50),
    last_name   VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO customers (id, first_name, last_name) VALUES
(1, 'Carolyn', 'O''Lunny'),
(2, 'Matteo', 'Husthwaite'),
(3, 'Melessa', 'Rowesby');



CREATE TABLE campaigns (
    id          INT,
    customer_id INT,
    name        VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO campaigns (id, customer_id, name) VALUES
(2, 1, 'Overcoming Challenges'),
(4, 1, 'Business Rules'),
(3, 2, 'YUI'),
(1, 3, 'Quantitative Finance'),
(5, 3, 'MMC');



CREATE TABLE events (
    campaign_id INT,
    status      VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO events (campaign_id, status) VALUES
(1, 'success'), (1, 'success'), (2, 'success'), (2, 'success'), (2, 'success'),
(2, 'success'), (2, 'success'), (3, 'success'), (3, 'success'), (3, 'success'),
(4, 'success'), (4, 'success'), (4, 'failure'), (4, 'failure'), (5, 'failure'),
(5, 'failure'), (5, 'failure'), (5, 'failure'), (5, 'failure'), (5, 'failure'),
(4, 'success'), (5, 'success'), (5, 'success'), (1, 'failure'), (1, 'failure'),
(1, 'failure'), (2, 'failure'), (3, 'failure');
```

### Expected Output 

event_type | customer | campaign | total | 
--|--|--|--|
success | Carolyn O'Lunny | Business Rules, Overcoming Challenges | 8
failure | Melessa Rowesby | MMC, Quantitative Finance | 9 |


### Solution Query 

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
	SELECT   status, 
	         CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) as customer, 
	         STRING_AGG(DISTINCT name, ', ') as campaign, 
	         COUNT(*) AS total,
	         RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY status ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rn
	FROM     customers c JOIN campaigns ca ON c.id=ca.customer_id
	                     JOIN events e ON ca.id=e.campaign_id
	GROUP BY 1, 2
	ORDER BY 1 DESC
)
SELECT status, customer, campaign, total
FROM   CTE 
WHERE  rn=1
```

```sql
-- my initial attempt : 
-- no need for filtering success and failure counts.

WITH CTE AS (
	SELECT   status, 
	         CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) as customer, 
	         name, 
	         COUNT(*) FILTER(WHERE status='success') AS success_count,
	         COUNT(*) FILTER(WHERE status='failure') AS failure_count
	FROM     customers c JOIN campaigns ca ON c.id=ca.customer_id
	                     JOIN events e ON ca.id=e.campaign_id
	GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
	ORDER BY 1
)
SELECT   customer, 
	     STRING_AGG(DISTINCT name, ', ') as campaign, 
	     SUM(success_count) as total,
	     SUM(failure_count) as total
FROM     CTE 
GROUP BY 1
