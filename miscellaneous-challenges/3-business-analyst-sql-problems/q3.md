## Election Exit Poll by State Report

### Problem Statement 

As part of HackerPoll's election exit poll analytics, a team needs a list of candidates and their top 3 vote totals and the states where they occurred.

The result should be in the following format: candidate_name, 1st_place, 2nd_place, 3rd_place.


- Concatenate the candidate's first and last names with a space between them.

- 1st_place, 2nd_place, 3rd_place are comma-separated US state names and numbers of votes in a format "%statename% (%votes%)", for example "New York (23)".

- Results should be sorted ascending by candidate_name.


### Schema setup 

```sql
CREATE TABLE candidates_tab (
    id          INT,
    first_name  VARCHAR(50),
    last_name   VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO candidates_tab (id, first_name, last_name) VALUES
(1, 'Davide', 'Kentish'),
(2, 'Thorstein', 'Bridge');



CREATE TABLE results_tab (
    candidate_id    INT,
    state           VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO results_tab (candidate_id, state) VALUES
(1, 'Alabama'), (1, 'Alabama'), (1, 'California'), (1, 'California'), (1, 'California'),
(1, 'California'), (1, 'California'), (2, 'California'), (2, 'California'), (2, 'New York'),
(2, 'New York'), (2, 'Texas'), (2, 'Texas'), (2, 'Texas'), (1, 'New York'),
(1, 'Texas'), (1, 'Texas'), (1, 'Texas'), (2, 'California'), (2, 'Alabama');
```

### Expected Output 

candidate_name | 1st_place | 2nd_place | 3rd_place |
--|--|--|--|
Davide Kentish | California (5) | Texas (3) | Alabama (2) | 
Thorstein Bridge | California (3), Texas (3) | New York (2) | Alabama (1) | 


### Solution Query 

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT   CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS candidate_name,
             state,
             COUNT(1) AS total,
             DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) ORDER BY COUNT(1) DESC) AS rn
    FROM     candidates_tab c JOIN results_tab r ON r.candidate_id = c.id
    GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT   candidate_name,
         STRING_AGG(CASE WHEN rn = 1 THEN state || ' (' || total || ')' END, ', ' ORDER BY state) AS "1st_place",
         STRING_AGG(CASE WHEN rn = 2 THEN state || ' (' || total || ')' END, ', ') AS "2nd_place",
         STRING_AGG(CASE WHEN rn = 3 THEN state || ' (' || total || ')' END, ', ') AS "3rd_place"
FROM     CTE 
WHERE    rn <= 3
GROUP BY 1
