## Election Results

### Problem Statement 

Given a database of the results of an election, find the number of seats won by each party. There are some rules to going about this:

- There are many constituencies in a state and many candidates who are contesting the election from each constituency.

- Each candidate belongs to a party.

- The candidate with the maximum number of votes in a given constituency wins for that constituency.

The output should be in the following format: Party Seats_won.

The ordering should be in the order of seats won in descending order.


### Schema setup 

```sql
CREATE TABLE candidates (
    id      INT,
    gender  VARCHAR(1),
    age     INT,
    party   VARCHAR(20)
);

INSERT INTO candidates (id, gender, age, party) VALUES
(1, 'M', 55, 'Democratic'),
(2, 'M', 51, 'Democratic'),
(3, 'F', 62, 'Democratic'),
(4, 'M', 60, 'Republic'),
(5, 'F', 61, 'Republic'),
(6, 'F', 58, 'Republic');


CREATE TABLE results (
    constituency_id     INT,
    candidate_id        INT,
    votes               INT
);

INSERT INTO results (constituency_id, candidate_id, votes) VALUES
(1, 1, 847529),
(1, 4, 283409),
(2, 2, 293841),
(2, 5, 394385),
(3, 3, 429084),
(3, 6, 303890);
```

### Expected Output 

party | seats_won | 
--|--|
Democratic | 2 | 
Republic | 1 | 


### Solution Query 

```sql
WITH votes_cte AS (
	SELECT party, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY constituency_id ORDER BY votes DESC) AS rn 
	FROM   candidates c JOIN results r ON c.id=r.candidate_id
)
SELECT   party, COUNT(party) AS seats_won
FROM     votes_cte
WHERE    rn=1
GROUP BY 1
```
