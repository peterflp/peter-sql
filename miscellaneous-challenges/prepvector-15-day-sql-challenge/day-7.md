## Multi-Day Customer Count

### Problem Statement 

Weâ€™re given a table of product purchases. Each row in the table represents an individual user product purchase.

Write a query to get the number of customers that were upsold by purchasing additional products.

`Note:` If a customer purchased multiple products on the same day, it does not count as an upsell. An upsell is considered only if they made purchases on separate days


### Schema setup 

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER,
    created_at DATETIME,
    product_id INTEGER,
    quantity INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO transactions (id, user_id, created_at, product_id, quantity) VALUES
(1, 101, '2024-01-01 10:00:00', 1, 1),  
(2, 101, '2024-01-01 14:00:00', 2, 1),
(3, 101, '2024-01-15 09:00:00', 3, 1), 
(4, 102, '2024-01-05 11:00:00', 1, 2),
(5, 102, '2024-01-05 11:30:00', 2, 1),
(6, 103, '2024-01-02 15:00:00', 1, 1),
(7, 104, '2024-01-01 09:00:00', 1, 1),
(8, 104, '2024-01-02 10:00:00', 2, 1),
(9, 104, '2024-01-03 11:00:00', 3, 1);
```

### Expected Output 

upsold_customer_count |
--|
2 |


### Solution Query 

```sql
WITH unique_purchases as (
    SELECT user_id, DATE(created_at) AS purchase_date
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY user_id, DATE(created_at)
)
, upsold_customers as (
    SELECT   user_id
    FROM     unique_purchases
    GROUP BY user_id
    HAVING   COUNT(purchase_date) > 1
)
SELECT COUNT(user_id) as upsold_customer_count
FROM   upsold_customers



-- initial attempt:

WITH cte as (
    SELECT user_id, date(created_at), COUNT(*) as cnt
    FROM   transactions
    GROUP BY user_id, date(created_at)
)
SELECT   COUNT(distinct user_id) as upsold_customer_count
FROM     cte
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING   COUNT(purchase_date) > 1
