);

INSERT INTO employee VALUES

---

*Solution:*

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT dep_id, 
       FIRST_VALUE(emp_name) OVER(PARTITION BY dep_id 
                                  ORDER BY salary DESC ) as max_salary_emp, 
       LAST_VALUE(emp_name) OVER(PARTITION BY dep_id 
                                 ORDER BY salary DESC 
                                 RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) 
as min_salary_emp
FROM   employee


-- my attempt 

WITH ranked_salaries AS (
	SELECT *, 
	       RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY dep_id ORDER BY salary desc) AS h_rn,
	       RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY dep_id ORDER BY salary) AS l_rn
	FROM   employee
)
SELECT dep_id, 
       CASE WHEN h_rn=1 THEN emp_name END AS max_salary_employee,
	   CASE WHEN l_rn=1 THEN emp_name END AS min_salary_employee
FROM   ranked_salaries


-- NOTE: learnt about the FIRST_VALUE & the LAST_VALUE window functions.
```

*Output:*
