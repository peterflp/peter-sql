###  6. Generate IPL matches schedule

*Problem statement:*  

There are a total of 10 IPL teams. 

1. Write a SQL query such that each team plays with every team only **once**.

2. Write a SQL query such that each team plays with every team **twice**.

*Corresponding schema:*

```sql
CREATE TABLE teams (
    team_code VARCHAR(10),
    team_name VARCHAR(40)
);

INSERT INTO teams (team_code, team_name) VALUES
('RCB', 'Royal Challengers Bangalore'),
('MI', 'Mumbai Indians'),
('CSK', 'Chennai Super Kings'),
('DC', 'Delhi Capitals'),
('RR', 'Rajasthan Royals'),
('SRH', 'Sunrisers Hyderbad'),
('PBKS', 'Punjab Kings'),
('KKR', 'Kolkata Knight Riders'),
('GT', 'Gujarat Titans'),
('LSG', 'Lucknow Super Giants');
```

---

*Solution:*

```sql
-- 1. teams playing each other only once

-- total matches played would be: 9C2 = 45.

WITH CTE AS (
	SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY team_name) AS rn
	FROM   teams
)
SELECT a.team_name AS home_team, b.team_name AS away_team
FROM   CTE a JOIN CTE b ON a.rn < b.rn


-- 2. teams playing each other twice

-- total matches played would be: n(n-1) = 90.

WITH CTE AS (
	SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY team_name) AS rn
	FROM   teams
)
SELECT a.team_name AS home_team, b.team_name AS away_team
FROM   CTE a JOIN CTE b ON a.rn <> b.rn
```
