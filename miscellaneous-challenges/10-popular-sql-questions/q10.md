### 10. Calculate Pizza Delivery Final Status by Customer


*Problem statement:*  

A pizza company is taking orders from customers, and each pizza ordered is added to their database as a separate order.

Each order has an associated status, "CREATED or SUBMITTED or DELIVERED'.

An order's Final_ Status is calculated based on status as follows:	

1. When all orders for a customer have a status of DELIVERED, that customer's order has a Final_Status of COMPLETED.

2. If a customer has some orders that are not DELIVERED and some orders that are DELIVERED, the Final_ Status is IN PROGRESS.

3. If all of a customer's orders are SUBMITTED, the Final_Status is AWAITING PROGRESS.

4. Otherwise, the Final Status is AWAITING SUBMISSION.

Write a query to report the customer_name and Final_Status of each customer's order. Order the results by customer name.	


*Corresponding schema:*

```sql
CREATE TABLE cust_orders (
    cust_name VARCHAR(50),
    order_id  VARCHAR(10),
    status    VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO cust_orders (cust_name, order_id, status) VALUES 
('John', 'J1', 'DELIVERED'),
('John', 'J2', 'DELIVERED'),
('David', 'D1', 'SUBMITTED'),
('David', 'D2', 'DELIVERED'), -- This record is missing in question
('David', 'D3', 'CREATED'),
('Smith', 'S1', 'SUBMITTED'),
('Krish', 'K1', 'CREATED');

COMMIT;

*Solution:*

```sql
SELECT   cust_name AS customer_name,
		 CASE
			 WHEN COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'DELIVERED' THEN 1 END) = COUNT(*) THEN 'COMPLETED'
			 WHEN COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'DELIVERED' THEN 1 END) > 0 THEN 'IN PROGRESS'
			 WHEN COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'SUBMITTED' THEN 1 END) = COUNT(*) THEN 'AWAITING PROGRESS'
			 ELSE 'AWAITING SUBMISSION'
		 END AS Final_Status
FROM     cust_orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1

```
