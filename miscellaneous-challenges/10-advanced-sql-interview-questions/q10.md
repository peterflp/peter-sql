### 10. Calculate moving average of last 3 transactions for long-term customers

*Problem statement:*

You have two tables: 'customer_transactions' with columns (customer_id, transaction_date, transaction_amount), and 'customer_info' with columns (customer_id, customer_name, signup_date). 

**Write a query to calculate the moving average of transaction amounts for each customer over their last 3 transactions, but only for customers who have been signed up for more than a year.**

*Corresponding schema:*

```sql
CREATE TABLE customer_info (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100),
    signup_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE customer_transactions (
    transaction_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customer_info(customer_id),
    transaction_date DATE,
    transaction_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO customer_info (customer_name, signup_date) VALUES
('Alice', '2022-01-01'),
('Bob', '2022-06-01'),
('Charlie', '2021-12-01'),
('David', '2023-01-01');

INSERT INTO customer_transactions (customer_id, transaction_date, transaction_amount) VALUES
(1, '2023-05-01', 100.00),
(1, '2023-05-15', 150.00),
(1, '2023-06-01', 200.00),
(1, '2023-06-15', 175.00),
(2, '2023-05-01', 50.00),
(2, '2023-06-01', 75.00),
(3, '2023-05-01', 300.00),
(3, '2023-05-15', 250.00),
(3, '2023-06-01', 350.00),
(3, '2023-06-15', 400.00),
(4, '2023-05-01', 80.00),
(4, '2023-06-01', 120.00);
```

---

*Solution:*

```sql
WITH ranked_transactions AS (
    SELECT customer_id,
           transaction_date,
           transaction_amount,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_date DESC) AS rn
    FROM   customer_transactions
	WHERE  customer_id IN (
	 			SELECT customer_id
    			FROM   customer_info
    			WHERE  signup_date <= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 YEAR'
			)
),
last_3_transactions AS (
    SELECT customer_id, transaction_date, transaction_amount
    FROM   ranked_transactions
    WHERE  rn <= 3
)
SELECT   customer_id, ROUND(AVG(transaction_amount), 2) AS moving_avg
FROM     last_3_transactions
GROUP BY 1


-- NOTE: not a 100% sure about the solution; will help if had a expected output.
