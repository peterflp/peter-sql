### 9. Find employees promoted within 6 months of hire

*Problem statement:*  

Using a table 'employee_positions' with columns (employee_id, position, start_date, end_date).

**Write a query to find employees who have been promoted (i.e. changed to a different position) within 6 months of their initial hire.**

*Corresponding schema:*

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee_positions (
    employee_id INTEGER,
    position VARCHAR(100),
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO employee_positions (employee_id, position, start_date, end_date) VALUES
(1, 'Junior Developer', '2023-01-01', '2023-05-31'),
(1, 'Developer', '2023-06-01', NULL),
(2, 'Sales Associate', '2023-02-01', '2023-09-30'),
(2, 'Sales Manager', '2023-10-01', NULL),
(3, 'Marketing Specialist', '2023-03-01', NULL),
(4, 'Customer Support', '2023-04-01', '2023-08-31'),
(4, 'Customer Support Lead', '2023-09-01', NULL),
(5, 'Data Analyst', '2023-05-01', NULL);
```

*Solution:*

```sql
WITH ranked_positions AS (
    SELECT employee_id,
           position,
           start_date,
           end_date,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY employee_id ORDER BY start_date) AS rn
    FROM   employee_positions
),
initial_positions AS (
    SELECT employee_id, start_date AS initial_start_date
    FROM   ranked_positions
    WHERE  rn=1
),
promotions_cte AS (
    SELECT rp.employee_id, rp.position, rp.start_date, ip.initial_start_date
    FROM   ranked_positions rp JOIN initial_positions ip USING(employee_id)
    WHERE  rp.start_date > ip.initial_start_date AND 
	       rp.start_date <= ip.initial_start_date + INTERVAL '6 months' AND
           rp.rn > 1
)
SELECT DISTINCT employee_id
FROM   promotions_cte
```
