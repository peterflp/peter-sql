### 5. Divide customers into 10 spending deciles

*Problem statement:*  

Given is a table 'customer_spending' with columns (customer_id, total_spend).

**Divide customers into 10 deciles based on their total spending.**

*Corresponding schema:*

```sql
CREATE TABLE customer_spending (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    total_spend DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO customer_spending (total_spend) VALUES
(100.00), (250.00), (500.00), (750.00), (1000.00),
(1250.00), (1500.00), (1750.00), (2000.00), (2250.00),
(2500.00), (2750.00), (3000.00), (3250.00), (3500.00),
(3750.00), (4000.00), (4250.00), (4500.00), (4750.00);
```

---

*Solution:*

```sql
-- Solution 1: using NTILE WINDOW function.

SELECT customer_id, total_spend, NTILE(10) OVER(ORDER BY total_spend) 
FROM   customer_spending



-- Solution 2: w/o using WINDOW function.

WITH ranked_customers AS (
    SELECT customer_id,
           total_spend,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY total_spend) AS rn,
           COUNT(*) OVER() AS total_customers
    FROM   customer_spending
),
decile_cte AS (
    SELECT customer_id, total_spend, rn, total_customers, CEIL(rn * 10.0 / total_customers) AS decile
    FROM   ranked_customers
)
SELECT   customer_id, total_spend, decile
FROM     decile_cte
ORDER BY 2
```
