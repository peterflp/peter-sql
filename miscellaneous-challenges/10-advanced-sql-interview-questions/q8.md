### 8. Identify top 5 employees by sales in each department

*Problem statement:*  

You have two tables 'employee_sales' with columns (employee_id, department_id, sales_amount) and 'employees' with columns (employee_id, employee_name).

**Write a query to identify the top 5 employees by sales amount in each department.**

*Corresponding schema:*

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE employee_sales (
    employee_id INTEGER REFERENCES employees(employee_id),
    department_id INTEGER,
    sales_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id, department_id)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO employees (employee_name) VALUES
('John Doe'), ('Jane Smith'), ('Bob Johnson'), ('Alice Brown'), ('Charlie Davis'),
('Eve Wilson'), ('Frank Thomas'), ('Grace Lee'), ('Henry Clark'), ('Ivy Moore');

INSERT INTO employee_sales (employee_id, department_id, sales_amount) VALUES
(1, 1, 50000), (2, 1, 60000), (3, 1, 55000), (4, 1, 65000), (5, 1, 70000),
(6, 1, 52000), (7, 1, 58000), (8, 2, 75000), (9, 2, 80000), (10, 2, 72000),
(1, 2, 68000), (2, 2, 70000), (3, 2, 73000), (4, 2, 78000), (5, 2, 76000);
```

---

*Solution:*

```sql
WITH ranked_sales AS (
    SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY es.department_id ORDER BY es.sales_amount DESC) AS dr
    FROM   employee_sales es JOIN employees e USING(employee_id)
)
SELECT   employee_id, employee_name, department_id, sales_amount
FROM     ranked_sales
WHERE    dr <= 5
ORDER BY 3
```

*Output:*
