### 7. Find Length of Longest Consecutive Sequence

*Problem statement:* 
 
Find the length of the longest consecutive sequence of numbers in a table.

*Corresponding schema:*

```sql
CREATE TABLE consecutive (
    number INT
);

INSERT INTO consecutive VALUES
(1),
(2),
(3),
(5),
(6),
(8),
(9),
(10),
(11);
```

*Solution:*

```sql
WITH row_num_cte as (
    SELECT number, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY number) as row_num
    FROM   consecutive
)
,get_bins as (
    SELECT number, row_num, number-row_num as bin 
    FROM   row_num_cte
)
SELECT   COUNT(*) as longest_consecutive_seq
FROM     get_bins
GROUP BY bin
ORDER BY 1 desc
LIMIT    1
```

*Output:*

longest_consecutive_seq |
