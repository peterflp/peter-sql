*Problem statement:*  

Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively in a log table.

*Corresponding schema:*

```sql
CREATE TABLE logs (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    num INT
);

INSERT INTO logs VALUES
(1, 5),
(2, 5),
(3, 5),
(4, 3),
(5, 4),
(6, 4),
(7, 4),
(8, 5),
(9, 5);
```

*Solution:*

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num
FROM   logs l1 JOIN logs l2 ON l1.num = l2.num and l1.id = l2.id - 1
               JOIN logs l3 ON l1.num = l3.num and l1.id = l3.id - 2
```

*Output:*

num |
