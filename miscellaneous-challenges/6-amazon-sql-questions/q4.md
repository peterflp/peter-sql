### Problem Statement

Find employees who earn the top three salaries in each department.


### Schema Setup

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    salary INT,
    department_id INT
);

CREATE TABLE department (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);


INSERT INTO employee (id, name, salary, department_id) VALUES
(1, 'Joe', 85000, 1),
(2, 'Henry', 80000, 2),
(3, 'Sam', 60000, 2),
(4, 'Max', 90000, 1),
(5, 'Janet', 69000, 1),
(6, 'Randy', 85000, 1),
(7, 'Will', 70000, 1);

INSERT INTO department (id, name) VALUES
(1, 'IT'),
(2, 'Sales');
```



### Solution Query

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT d.name AS "Department Name",
           e.name AS "Employee Name",
           e.salary,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY d.Name ORDER BY e.salary DESC) as rank
    FROM   employee e JOIN department d ON d.id=e.department_id
)
SELECT *
FROM   CTE
WHERE  rank <= 3
```



### Result Output

Department Name |	Employee Name |	salary |	rank |
--|--|--|--|
IT |	Max |	90000 |	1 |
IT |	Randy |	85000 |	2 |
IT |	Joe |	85000 |	2 |
