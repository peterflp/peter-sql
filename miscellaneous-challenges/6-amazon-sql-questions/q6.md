### Problem Statement

How can we transpose a table using SQL (changing rows to columns or vice versa). For instance, how can we return from a table like the one below (will show table).


### Schema Setup

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    product VARCHAR(50),
    customer_id INT
);

INSERT INTO sales (product, customer_id) VALUES
('Product A', 1),
('Product A', 2),
('Product A', 1),
('Product B', 1),
('Product B', 3),
('Product C', 2),
('Product C', 1),
('Product C', 3),
('Product C', 2),
('Product A', 3);
```



### Solution Query

```sql
-- 1. PIVOT - using CASE statements

SELECT   product,
         SUM(CASE WHEN customer_id=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Customer_1,
         SUM(CASE WHEN customer_id=2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Customer_2,
         SUM(CASE WHEN customer_id=3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Customer_3
FROM     sales
GROUP BY 1



-- 2. UNPIVOT - using UNION ALL

SELECT customer_id, 'Product A' as product
FROM   sales
WHERE  Product_A = 1
UNION ALL
SELECT customer_id, 'Product B' as product
FROM   sales
WHERE  Product_B = 1
UNION ALL
SELECT customer_id, 'Product C' as product
FROM   sales
WHERE  Product_C = 1
```



### Result Output

`PIVOT` output -->

| Product    | Customer_1 | Customer_2 | Customer_3 |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Product B  |      1      |      0      |      1      |
| Product A  |      2      |      1      |      1      |
| Product C  |      1      |      2      |      1      |
