### Problem Statement

There are 2 tables, first table has 5 records and second table has 10 records. You can assume any values in each of the tables. 

How many maximum and minimum records possible in case of inner join, left join, right join and full outer join ??



### Solution

```sql
-- Basically, a theoritical question: 

-- so for max records possible, all the records of table 1 and table 2 should be the same. 
-- and so for minimum records possible, all the records of table 1 and table 2 should be different.
```
