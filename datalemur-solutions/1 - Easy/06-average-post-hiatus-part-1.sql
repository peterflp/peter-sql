-- Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.


-- Solution 1 : 

SELECT   user_id, MAX(post_date::DATE) - MIN(post_date::DATE) as days_between
FROM     posts
WHERE    EXTRACT(year from post_date)=2021
GROUP BY 1
HAVING   COUNT(post_id) > 1



-- other ways to handle dates : 
-- 1. EXTRACT(DAY FROM (MAX(post_date) - MIN(post_date))) or EXTRACT('days' from MAX(post_date) - MIN(post_date))

-- 2. post_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31' or DATE_PART('year', post_date::DATE) = 2021 



-- first approach : 
-- lead to this output : "days":307,"hours":11

SELECT   user_id, MAX(post_date) - MIN(post_date) as days_between
FROM     posts
WHERE    EXTRACT(year from post_date)=2021
GROUP BY 1


-- REMARKS : "::DATE" new thing to learn.
