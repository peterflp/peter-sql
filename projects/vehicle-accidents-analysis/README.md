## Introduction

In this project, our goal is to delve into `accident data` to extract `valuable insights` regarding the circumstances and patterns surrounding vehicle accidents. 

Utilizing SQL, we aim to efficiently `extract, transform, and analyze` the dataset. The outcomes of this analysis will be instrumental in understanding the factors that `contribute` to accidents, paving the way for strategic `recommendations` to enhance road safety. 

Our examination will encompass scrutinizing the interplay between various variables, including `area type, day of the week, vehicle age, and weather conditions`, and their corresponding influence on accident occurrences and severity. 

Furthermore, we will conduct `trend analysis` to identify and analyze the most critical factors contributing to severe accidents, providing a comprehensive understanding of accident dynamics.



## Datasets

This dataset contains tables, in CSV format:

- The `Accident` table contains information about each accident, including details about the area, weather & light conditions, and severity.

- The `Vehicle` table contains information about vehicles involved in accidents, including details about vehicle type, age, and whether the vehicle is left-hand drive.
