## Introduction

In the scope of this project, our focus lies in delving into `restaurant ratings data` to extract `valuable insights` regarding the performance of diverse dining establishments. 

Employing SQL, we aim to efficiently `extract, transform, and analyze` the dataset. The outcomes of this analysis will be instrumental in comprehending the factors that `impact` a restaurant's rating, paving the way for strategic `recommendations` to enhance performance. Our examination will encompass scrutinizing the interplay between various variables, including `location, cuisine, and price range`, and their corresponding influence on restaurant ratings. 

Furthermore, we will conduct `sentiment analysis` to identify and analyze the most favorably reviewed restaurants, providing a comprehensive understanding of customer preferences.



## Dataset

This dataset contains 5 tables, in CSV format:

- The `Consumers` table contains information for 138 consumers (each record represents one consumer), with fields containing details about their location, age, method of transportation, employment status, budget, and more.

- The `Consumer Preferences` table contains the types of cuisine that each user prefers.

- The `Restaurants` table contains information for 130 restaurants (each record represents one restaurant), with fields containing details about its location, price, types of service, and more.

- The `Restaurant Cuisines` table contains the types of cuisine that each restaurant serves.

- The `Ratings` table contains overall, food, and service ratings by consumers for the restaurants.


## Recommended Analysis 

1. What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on ratings?

2. What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?

3. Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?

4. If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?



## Approach 

- `Data Acquisition`: Obtained restaurant ratings data from a publicly available source, importing it into an SQL database for further analysis.

- `Data Cleaning`: Utilized SQL to cleanse the data, ensuring it is formatted for easy analysis. Tasks included removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats.

- `Information Extraction`: Employed SQL to extract pertinent details such as average restaurant ratings, review counts, and locations.

- `Advanced SQL Analysis`: Utilized advanced SQL commands and functions to delve into the datasets, identifying patterns and trends.

- `Metric Exploration`: Conducted a comprehensive analysis of various metrics using SQL commands and functions.

- `Recommendations for Improvement`: Leveraged insights gained from the analysis to provide recommendations for restaurant enhancement and proposed ways to use the data for informed business decisions
