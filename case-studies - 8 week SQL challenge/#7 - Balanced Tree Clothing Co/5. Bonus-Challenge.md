## Case Study Questions - Bonus Challenge


Use a single SQL query to transform the `product_hierarchy` and `product_prices` datasets to the `product_details` table.

Hint: you may want to consider using a recursive CTE to solve this problem!

## Solution:


```sql
WITH RECURSIVE product_tree AS (
  SELECT CAST(ph.id AS INTEGER) AS id,
         CAST(ph.parent_id AS INTEGER) AS parent_id,
         ph.level_text,
         ph.level_name,
         CAST(pp.price AS INTEGER) AS price
  FROM   balanced_tree.product_hierarchy ph LEFT JOIN balanced_tree.product_prices pp ON CAST(ph.id AS VARCHAR) = pp.product_id
  WHERE  CAST(ph.parent_id AS INTEGER) IS NULL

  UNION ALL

  SELECT CAST(ph.id AS INTEGER) AS id,
         CAST(ph.parent_id AS INTEGER) AS parent_id,
         ph.level_text,
         ph.level_name,
         CAST(pp.price AS INTEGER) AS price
    
  FROM   balanced_tree.product_hierarchy ph LEFT JOIN balanced_tree.product_prices pp ON CAST(ph.id AS VARCHAR) = pp.product_id INNER JOIN product_tree pt ON CAST(ph.parent_id AS INTEGER) = pt.id
)
INSERT INTO balanced_tree.product_details (
  product_id,
  price,
  product_name,
  category_id,
  segment_id,
  style_id,
  category_name,
  segment_name,
  style_name
)
SELECT LPAD(CAST(id AS VARCHAR), 6, '0') AS product_id,
       price,
       level_name,
       CASE WHEN level_text LIKE '%Category%' THEN CAST(SUBSTRING(level_text, POSITION('Category' IN level_text) + 8) AS INTEGER) ELSE NULL END AS category_id,
       CASE WHEN level_text LIKE '%Segment%' THEN CAST(SUBSTRING(level_text, POSITION('Segment' IN level_text) + 7) AS INTEGER) ELSE NULL END AS segment_id,
       CASE WHEN level_text LIKE '%Style%' THEN CAST(SUBSTRING(level_text, POSITION('Style' IN level_text) + 5) AS INTEGER) ELSE NULL END AS style_id,
       CASE WHEN level_text LIKE '%Category%' THEN SUBSTRING(level_text, 1, POSITION('Category' IN level_text) - 1) ELSE NULL END AS category_name,
       CASE WHEN level_text LIKE '%Segment%' THEN SUBSTRING(level_text, 1, POSITION('Segment' IN level_text) - 1) ELSE NULL END AS segment_name,
       CASE WHEN level_text LIKE '%Style%' THEN SUBSTRING(level_text, 1, POSITION('Style' IN level_text) - 1) ELSE NULL END AS style_name
FROM   product_tree;
```
