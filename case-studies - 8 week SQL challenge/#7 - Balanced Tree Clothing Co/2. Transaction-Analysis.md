## Case Study Questions - Transactions Analysis

1. How many unique transactions were there?

2. What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?

3. What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?

4. What is the average discount value per transaction?

5. What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?

6. What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?

## Solutions:

Let's collaborate on running the queries using PostgreSQL on [Transactions Analysis - DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/o7YcVhXYUpcxidxJmhqZAc/6).

---

### 1. How many unique transactions were there?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) as transaction_count
FROM   balanced_tree.sales
```

#### Result set:


transaction_count | 
--|
2500 | 

---

### 2. What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?


```sql
WITH unique_products_per_txn AS (
  SELECT   txn_id,
           SUM(qty) AS total_quantity
  FROM     balanced_tree.sales
  GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(total_quantity)) AS avg_unique_products_per_txn
FROM   unique_products_per_txn;
```

#### Result set:

avg_unique_products_per_txn |
--|
18 |

---

### 3. What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?


```sql
WITH revenue_cte AS (
  SELECT   txn_id, 
           SUM(price * qty) AS revenue
  FROM     balanced_tree.sales
  GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) as 25th_percentile,
       PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) as 50th_percentile,
       PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) as 75th_percentile
FROM   revenue_cte;
```

#### Result set:

25th_percentile |	50th_percentile |	75th_percentile |
--|--|--|
375.75 |	509.5 |	647 |


---

### 4. What is the average discount value per transaction?


```sql
WITH txn_discounts AS (
  SELECT   txn_id,
           SUM(qty * price * discount/100) AS discount_amt
  FROM     balanced_tree.sales
  GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(discount_amt)) AS avg_discount_per_txn
FROM   txn_discounts;
```

#### Result set:

avg_discount_per_txn |
--|
60 |

---

### 5. What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?


```sql
WITH txn_counts AS (
  SELECT   member,
           COUNT(*) AS transaction_count
  FROM     balanced_tree.sales
  GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT member,
       ROUND(transaction_count * 100.0 / (SELECT SUM(transaction_count) FROM tx_counts), 2) AS percentage
FROM   txn_counts;
```

#### Result set:

member |	percentage |
--|--|
false |	39.97 |
true |	60.03 |

---

### 6. What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?


```sql
WITH revenue_cte AS (
  SELECT   member,
  	       txn_id,
           SUM(price * qty) AS revenue
  FROM     balanced_tree.sales
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)

SELECT   member,
         ROUND(AVG(revenue), 2) AS avg_revenue
FROM     revenue_cte
GROUP BY 1
```

#### Result set:

member |	avg_revenue |
--|--|
false |	515.04 |
true |	516.27 |
