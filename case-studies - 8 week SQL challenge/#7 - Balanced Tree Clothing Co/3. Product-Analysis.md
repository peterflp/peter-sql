## Solutions:

Let's collaborate on running the queries using PostgreSQL on [Product Analysis - DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/fXdL3MiJmVuLPzjfFTGeRG/11).

### 1. What are the top 3 products by total revenue before discount?



```sql
SELECT   p.product_name, 
         SUM(s.qty) * SUM(s.price) as total_revenue
FROM     balanced_tree.sales s JOIN balanced_tree.product_details p ON s.prod_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT    3
```

#### Result set:

product_name |	total_revenue |
--|--|
Blue Polo Shirt - Mens |	276022044 |
Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens |	266862600 |
White Tee Shirt - Mens |	192736000 |

### 2. What is the total quantity, revenue and discount for each segment?



```sql
SELECT   p.segment_name, 
         SUM(s.qty) AS total_quantity,
         SUM(s.qty) * SUM(s.price) as total_revenue,
         SUM(s.qty * s.price * s.discount/100) as total_discount
FROM     balanced_tree.sales s JOIN balanced_tree.product_details p ON s.prod_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY 1
```
