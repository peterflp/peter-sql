## Case Study Questions - Customer Nodes Exploration

1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?

2. What is the number of nodes per region?

3. How many customers are allocated to each region?

4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?

5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?

## Solutions:

Let's collaborate on running the queries using PostgreSQL on [Customer Nodes Exploration - DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/th98SWXVvnXXGMcvfuTWot/5).

### 1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(distinct node_id) as unique_nodes_count
FROM   data_bank.customer_nodes
```

#### Result set:

| unique_nodes_count |
| ------------------ |
| 5                  |

---

### 2. What is the number of nodes per region?

```sql
SELECT   region_name, COUNT(distinct node_id) as node_count_per_region
FROM     data_bank.customer_nodes JOIN data_bank.regions USING(region_id)
GROUP BY 1
```

#### Result set:

| region_name | node_count_per_region |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Africa      | 5                     |
| America     | 5                     |
| Asia        | 5                     |
| Australia   | 5                     |
| Europe      | 5                     |

---

### 3. How many customers are allocated to each region?

```sql
SELECT   region_name, COUNT(distinct customer_id) as customer_count_per_region
FROM     data_bank.customer_nodes JOIN data_bank.regions USING(region_id)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

#### Result set:

| region_name | customer_count_per_region |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| Australia   | 110                       |
| America     | 105                       |
| Africa      | 102                       |
| Asia        | 95                        |
| Europe      | 88                        |

### 4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?

```sql
WITH CTE as (
    SELECT customer_id,
           start_date,
           end_date,
           LEAD(start_date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS next_start_date
    FROM   data_bank.customer_nodes
)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(date_part('day', age(end_date, start_date)))) AS avg_days_reallocated
FROM   CTE
WHERE  next_start_date IS NOT NULL and end_date < next_start_date;



-- use of 'age' function : 

-- calculates the difference between end_date and start_date. 
-- The result of age() is an interval type, representing the span of time between these two dates. 
-- This interval includes years, months, and days.

-- in our case, it results in the following result set --> {"days":1}
```

#### Result set:

| avg_days_reallocated |
| -------------------- |
| 14                   |

---

### 5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?

```sql
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT r.region_name,
         date_part('day', age(cn.end_date, cn.start_date)) AS reallocation_days
  FROM   data_bank.customer_nodes cn JOIN data_bank.regions r USING(region_id)
  WHERE  cn.end_date < (SELECT MIN(start_date)
                        FROM data_bank.customer_nodes cn2
                        WHERE cn.customer_id = cn2.customer_id
                          and cn2.start_date > cn.end_date)
)
SELECT   region_name,
         PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY reallocation_days) AS median_days,
         PERCENTILE_CONT(0.8) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY reallocation_days) AS percentile_80,
         PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY reallocation_days) AS percentile_95
FROM     cte
GROUP BY 1
```

#### Result set:


region_name |	median_days |	percentile_80 |	percentile_95 |
--|--|--|--|
Africa |	15 |	23.80000000000001 |	28 |
America |	15 |	23 |	27 |
Asia |	14 |	23 |	28 |
Australia |	14 |	23 |	28 |
Europe |	15 |	24 |	28 |
