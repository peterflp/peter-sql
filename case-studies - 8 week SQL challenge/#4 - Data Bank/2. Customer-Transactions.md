## Solutions:

Let's collaborate on running the queries using PostgreSQL on [Customer Transactions - DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/iQsg2rXm3APQctsxLGCFrs/10).

### 1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?

```sql
SELECT   txn_type, COUNT(*) as unique_count, SUM(txn_amount) as total_amount
FROM     data_bank.customer_transactions
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2
```

#### Result set:

| txn_type   | unique_count | total_amount |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| withdrawal | 1580         | 793003       |
| purchase   | 1617         | 806537       |
| deposit    | 2671         | 1359168      |

---

### 2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?

```sql
WITH deposit_details AS (
  SELECT   customer_id,
           COUNT(customer_id) AS txn_count,
           AVG(txn_amount) AS avg_amount
  FROM     data_bank.customer_transactions
  WHERE    txn_type = 'deposit'
  GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(txn_count)) AS avg_deposit_count, ROUND(AVG(avg_amount)) AS avg_deposit_amount
FROM   deposit_details

```

#### Result set:

| avg_deposit_count | avg_deposit_amount |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| 5                 | 509                |

---

### 3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?

```sql
WITH transactions_aggregated AS (
  SELECT   customer_id,
    	   EXTRACT(month FROM txn_date) AS month,
           COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE txn_type = 'deposit') AS deposit_count,
    	   COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE txn_type = 'purchase') AS purchase_count,
    	   COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE txn_type = 'withdrawal') AS withdrawal_count
  FROM     data_bank.customer_transactions
  WHERE    txn_type IN ('deposit', 'purchase', 'withdrawal')
  GROUP BY 1, 2
),
filtered_customers AS (
  SELECT month, customer_id
  FROM   transactions_aggregated
  WHERE  (deposit_count > 1 AND purchase_count = 1) OR (deposit_count > 1 AND withdrawal_count = 1)
)
SELECT   month, COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM     filtered_customers
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:

| month | customer_count |
| ----- | -------------- |
| 1     | 115            |
| 2     | 108            |
| 3     | 113            |
| 4     | 50             |

### 4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?

```sql
WITH monthly_balance_cte as (
    SELECT  customer_id,
            EXTRACT(month from txn_date) AS txn_month,
            SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type='deposit' THEN txn_amount ELSE -txn_amount END) AS net_transaction_amt
   FROM     data_bank.customer_transactions
   GROUP BY 1, 2
   ORDER BY 1)
SELECT customer_id,
       txn_month,
       net_transaction_amt,
       SUM(net_transaction_amt) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id
                                     ORDER BY txn_month ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED preceding AND CURRENT ROW) as closing_balance
FROM   monthly_balance_cte;
```

#### Result set:

_results displayed only for the first 3 customer id's :_

| customer_id | txn_month | net_transaction_amt | closing_balance |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | 1         | 312                 | 312             |
| 1           | 3         | -952                | -640            |
| 2           | 1         | 549                 | 549             |
| 2           | 3         | 61                  | 610             |
| 3           | 1         | 144                 | 144             |
| 3           | 2         | -965                | -821            |
| 3           | 3         | -401                | -1222           |

### 5. What is the percentage of customers who increase their closing balance by more than 5%?

```sql
WITH monthly_balance_cte AS (
  SELECT   customer_id,
           EXTRACT(month FROM txn_date) AS txn_month,
           SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount ELSE -txn_amount END) AS net_transaction_amt,
           SUM(SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount ELSE -txn_amount END))
           OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY EXTRACT(month FROM txn_date)) AS closing_balance
  FROM     data_bank.customer_transactions
  GROUP BY 1, 2
  ORDER BY 1
),
percent_change AS (
  SELECT customer_id,
         CASE WHEN LAG(closing_balance, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_month) = 0 THEN 0
              ELSE ROUND(100.0 * (closing_balance - LAG(closing_balance, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_month)) /
                         LAG(closing_balance, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_month), 2)
         END AS pct_change
  FROM   monthly_balance_cte
)
SELECT ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN pct_change > 5 THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS pct_customer_over_5_pct_increase
FROM   percent_change;
```

#### Explanation :

1. checks if the previous month's closing balance is equal to 0; and if it is 0, it means the percent change cannot be calculated (`division by zero`), so set pct_change to 0.

```sql
WHEN LAG(closing_balance, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_month) = 0 THEN 0
```

2. formula used for percent change : 

```sql
(current_month_balance - previous_month_balance) / previous_month_balance * 100
```


#### Result set:

| pct_customer_over_5_pct_increase |
| -------------------------------- |
| 33.72                            |
