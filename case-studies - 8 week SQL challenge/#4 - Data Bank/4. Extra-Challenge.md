## Case Study Questions - Extra Challenge

Data Bank wants to try another option which is a bit more difficult to implement - they want to calculate data growth using an interest calculation, just like in a traditional savings account you might have with a bank.

If the annual interest rate is set at 6% and the Data Bank team wants to reward its customers by increasing their data allocation based off the interest calculated on a daily basis at the end of each day, how much data would be required for this option on a monthly basis?

Special notes:

- Data Bank wants an initial calculation which does not allow for compounding interest, however they may also be interested in a daily compounding interest calculation so you can try to perform this calculation if you have the stamina!

## Solution :

Let's collaborate on running the queries using PostgreSQL on [Extra Challenge - DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/m2oo42Ks4aL5gT4d2QYwfw/5).

**NOTE :** The solution provided below may `not` be correct.

### 1. Non-Compounding Interest Calculation

```sql
WITH customer_transactions_cte AS (
  SELECT customer_id,
         txn_date,
         txn_type,
         txn_amount,
         SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount ELSE -txn_amount END) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
  FROM   data_bank.customer_transactions
),
daily_interest_cte AS (
  SELECT customer_id,
         txn_date,
         running_balance,
         ROUND(running_balance * 0.06 / 365, 2) AS daily_interest
  FROM   customer_transactions_cte
)
SELECT   EXTRACT(month from txn_date) AS month,
         SUM(daily_interest) AS total_data_required_non_compounding
FROM     daily_interest_cte
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:

| month | total_data_required_non_compounding |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1     | 64.18                               |
| 2     | 3.76                                |
| 3     | -148.63                             |
| 4     | -80.90                              |

### 2. Compounding Interest Calculation

Formula : `running_balance * POW(1 + 0.06 / 365, 1) - running_balance`

```sql
WITH customer_transactions_cte AS (
  SELECT customer_id,
         txn_date,
         txn_type,
         txn_amount,
         SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount ELSE -txn_amount END) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
  FROM   data_bank.customer_transactions
),
daily_interest_cte AS (
  SELECT customer_id,
         txn_date,
         running_balance,
         ROUND(running_balance * POW(1 + 0.06 / 365, 1) - running_balance, 2) AS daily_interest
  FROM   customer_transactions_cte
),
monthly_interest_cte AS (
  SELECT   customer_id,
           EXTRACT(month from txn_date) AS month,
           MAX(running_balance) AS month_end_balance,
           ROUND(MAX(running_balance) * 0.06 / 12, 2) AS monthly_interest_non_compounding,
           ROUND(MAX(running_balance) * POW(1 + 0.06 / 12, 1) - MAX(running_balance), 2) AS monthly_interest_compounding
  FROM     customer_transactions_cte
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT   month,
         SUM(monthly_interest_non_compounding) AS total_data_required_non_compounding,
         SUM(monthly_interest_compounding) AS total_data_required_compounding
FROM     monthly_interest_cte
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

```

#### Result set:

month | 	total_data_required_non_compounding | 	total_data_required_compounding | 
--|--|--|
1 | 	1758.75 | 	1758.75 | 
2 | 	1152.76 | 	1152.76 | 
3 | 	545.96 | 	545.96 | 
4 | 	-395.03 | 	-395.03 |
