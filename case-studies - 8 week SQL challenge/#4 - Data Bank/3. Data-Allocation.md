## Case Study Questions - Data Allocation Challenge

To test out a few different hypotheses - the Data Bank team wants to run an experiment where different groups of customers would be allocated data using 3 different options:

- Option 1: data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end of the previous month

- Option 2: data is allocated on the average amount of money kept in the account in the previous 30 days

- Option 3: data is updated real-time

For this multi-part challenge question - you have been requested to generate the following data elements to help the Data Bank team estimate how much data will need to be provisioned for each option:

- running customer balance column that includes the impact each transaction

- customer balance at the end of each month

- minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer

Using all of the data available - how much data would have been required for each option on a monthly basis?

## Solution :

Let's collaborate on running the queries using PostgreSQL on [Data Allocation - DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/bMqJypJfQC4XwZ1VW8f83h/4).

To solve this challenge, we'll need to perform the following steps:

1. Calculate the running customer balance, including the impact of each transaction.

2. Calculate the customer balance at the end of each month.
3. Calculate the minimum, average, and maximum values of the running balance for each customer.
4. Estimate the data required for each option on a monthly basis.

**1. Calculate the running customer balance, including the impact of each transaction.**

```sql
WITH customer_transactions_cte AS (
  SELECT customer_id,
         txn_date,
         txn_type,
         txn_amount,
         SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount ELSE -txn_amount END) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
  FROM   data_bank.customer_transactions
)
SELECT *
FROM   customer_transactions_cte;
```

---

**2. Calculate the customer balance at the end of each month.**

```sql
WITH customer_transactions_cte AS (
  SELECT customer_id,
         txn_date,
         txn_type,
         txn_amount,
         SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount ELSE -txn_amount END) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
  FROM   data_bank.customer_transactions
),
monthly_balance_cte AS (
  SELECT   customer_id,
           DATE_TRUNC('month', txn_date) AS month_end_date,
           MAX(running_balance) AS month_end_balance
  FROM     customer_transactions_cte
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT *
FROM   monthly_balance_cte;
```

---

**3. Calculate the minimum, average, and maximum values of the running balance for each customer.**

```sql
WITH customer_transactions_cte AS (
  SELECT customer_id,
         txn_date,
         txn_type,
         txn_amount,
         SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount ELSE -txn_amount END) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
  FROM   data_bank.customer_transactions
),
customer_balance_stats_cte AS (
  SELECT   customer_id,
           MIN(running_balance) AS min_balance,
           AVG(running_balance) AS avg_balance,
           MAX(running_balance) AS max_balance
  FROM     customer_transactions_cte
  GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT *
FROM   customer_balance_stats_cte;
```

---

**4. Estimate the data required for each option on a monthly basis.**

`Option 1`: Data is allocated based on the amount of money at the end of the previous month.

The data required for this option would be the month-end balance for each customer, which we calculated in the second step.

```sql
WITH customer_transactions_cte AS (
  SELECT customer_id,
         txn_date,
         txn_type,
         txn_amount,
         SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount ELSE -txn_amount END) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
  FROM   data_bank.customer_transactions
),
monthly_balance_cte AS (
  SELECT   customer_id,
           DATE_TRUNC('month', txn_date) AS month_end_date,
           MAX(running_balance) AS month_end_balance
  FROM     customer_transactions_cte
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT   month,
         SUM(month_end_balance) AS total_data_required_option1
FROM     monthly_balance_cte
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:

| month | total_data_required_option1 |
| ----- | --------------------------- |
| 1     | 351521                      |
| 2     | 230473                      |
| 3     | 109155                      |
| 4     | -78991                      |

`Option 2`: Data is allocated on the average amount of money kept in the account in the previous 30 days.

- The data required for this option would be the average running balance for each customer, which we calculated in the third step.

```sql
WITH customer_transactions_cte AS (
  SELECT customer_id,
         txn_date,
         txn_type,
         txn_amount,
         SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount ELSE -txn_amount END) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
  FROM   data_bank.customer_transactions
),
customer_balance_stats_cte AS (
  SELECT   customer_id,
  		     EXTRACT(month from txn_date) as month,
           MIN(running_balance) AS min_balance,
           AVG(running_balance) AS avg_balance,
           MAX(running_balance) AS max_balance
  FROM     customer_transactions_cte
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT   month, ROUND(SUM(avg_balance), 2) AS total_data_required_option2
FROM     customer_balance_stats_cte
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:

month | total_data_required_option2 |
--|--|
1 | 182314.09 |
2 | 22331.26 |
3 | -125308.81 |
4 | -164041.32 |

---

`Option 3`: Data is updated real-time.

- The data required for this option would be the running balance for each transaction, which we calculated in the first step.

```sql
WITH customer_transactions_cte AS (
  SELECT customer_id,
         txn_date,
         txn_type,
         txn_amount,
         SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount ELSE -txn_amount END) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS running_balance
  FROM   data_bank.customer_transactions
)
SELECT   EXTRACT(month from txn_date) as month, COUNT(*) AS total_data_required_option3
FROM     customer_transactions_cte
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:


month |	total_data_required_option3 |
--|--|
1 |	1497 |
2 |	1715
3 |	1869 |
4 |	787 |
