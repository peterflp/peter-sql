## Case Study Questions - Ingredient Optimisation

1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?

2. What was the most commonly added extra?

3. What was the most common exclusion?

4. Generate an order item for each record in the `customers_orders` table in the format of one of the following:

   - `Meat Lovers`

   - `Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef`
   - `Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon`
   - `Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers`

5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the `customer_orders` table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients.

   For example: `"Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"`

6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

### 1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?

```sql
SELECT   pn.pizza_id, pn.pizza_name, pt.topping_id, pt.topping_name
FROM     pizza_runner.pizza_names pn JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_recipes pr USING(pizza_id)
                                     JOIN LATERAL unnest(string_to_array(pr.toppings, ',')::INTEGER[]) AS t(topping_id) ON true
                                     JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pt ON pt.topping_id = t.topping_id
ORDER BY 1
```

**Explanation:**

LATERAL JOIN with `unnest`:

1. **string_to_array(pr.toppings, ',')::INTEGER[]**: Converts the comma-separated string of topping IDs into an array of integers.

2. **unnest(...) AS t(topping_id)**: Expands this array into a set of rows, with each row representing an individual topping ID. This is done through a lateral join, which allows each row from pizza_recipes to be joined to multiple rows produced by unnest.

3. The **LATERAL** keyword is crucial here because it allows the unnest function to be applied to each row from the preceding pizza_recipes table, effectively "flattening" the list of toppings into individual rows.

4. The **ON true** condition for the lateral join is a formality in this context, as the unnest operation generates the rows to be joined without needing a specific condition.

#### Result set:

| pizza_id | pizza_name | topping_id | topping_name |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 2          | BBQ Sauce    |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 8          | Pepperoni    |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 4          | Cheese       |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 10         | Salami       |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 5          | Chicken      |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 1          | Bacon        |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 6          | Mushrooms    |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 3          | Beef         |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 12         | Tomato Sauce |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 4          | Cheese       |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 6          | Mushrooms    |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 7          | Onions       |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 9          | Peppers      |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 11         | Tomatoes     |

### 2. What was the most commonly added extra?

```sql
WITH extras_expanded AS (
  SELECT unnest(string_to_array(extras, ',')::INTEGER[]) AS extra_id
  FROM   temp_customer_orders
  WHERE  extras IS NOT NULL AND extras <> ''
)
,counted_extras AS (
  SELECT   extra_id, COUNT(*) AS frequency
  FROM     extras_expanded
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 2 DESC
)
SELECT   pt.topping_name, ce.frequency
FROM     counted_extras ce JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pt ON ce.extra_id = pt.topping_id
ORDER BY 2 DESC
-- LIMIT 1
```

#### Result set:

| topping_name | frequency |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Bacon        | 4         |
| Cheese       | 1         |
| Chicken      | 1         |

### 3. What was the most common exclusion?

```sql
WITH exclusions_expanded AS (
  SELECT unnest(string_to_array(exclusions, ',')::INTEGER[]) AS exclusion_id
  FROM   temp_customer_orders
  WHERE  exclusions IS NOT NULL AND exclusions <> '' AND exclusions <> 'null'
)
, counted_exclusions AS (
  SELECT   exclusion_id, COUNT(*) AS frequency
  FROM     exclusions_expanded
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 2 DESC
)
SELECT   pt.topping_name, ce.frequency
FROM     counted_exclusions ce JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pt ON ce.exclusion_id = pt.topping_id
ORDER BY 2 DESC
-- LIMIT 1;
```

#### Result set:

| topping_name | frequency |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Cheese       | 4         |
| BBQ Sauce    | 1         |
| Mushrooms    | 1         |

### 4. Generate an order item for each record in the `customers_orders` table in the format of one of the following:

- `Meat Lovers`

- `Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef`
- `Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon`
- `Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers`

```sql
WITH exclusion_names AS (
    SELECT  order_id,
            STRING_AGG(pt.topping_name, ', ') AS exclusions
    FROM    temp_customer_orders co CROSS JOIN LATERAL unnest(string_to_array(co.exclusions, ',')::INTEGER[]) AS excl(topping_id)
                                       JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pt ON pt.topping_id = excl.topping_id
    WHERE    co.exclusions <> '' AND co.exclusions IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 1
), extra_names AS (
    SELECT   order_id,
             STRING_AGG(pt.topping_name, ', ') AS extras
    FROM     temp_customer_orders co CROSS JOIN LATERAL unnest(string_to_array(co.extras, ',')::INTEGER[]) AS extr(topping_id)
                                         JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pt ON pt.topping_id = extr.topping_id
    WHERE    co.extras <> '' AND co.extras IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT   co.order_id,
         customer_id,
         pn.pizza_name ||
         CASE
             WHEN en.exclusions IS NOT NULL THEN ' - Exclude ' || en.exclusions
             ELSE ''
         END ||
         CASE
             WHEN ex.extras IS NOT NULL THEN ' - Extra ' || ex.extras
             ELSE ''
         END AS order_description

FROM     temp_customer_orders co JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn USING(pizza_id)
                                 LEFT JOIN exclusion_names en USING(order_id)
                                 LEFT JOIN extra_names ex USING(order_id)
ORDER BY 1, 2
```

#### Result set:

| order_id | customer_id | order_description                                               |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | 101         | Meatlovers                                                      |

### 5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the `customer_orders` table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients.

For example: `"Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"`

```sql
WITH Ingredients AS (
    SELECT    co.order_id,
              co.pizza_id,
              pt.topping_name,
              CASE
                  WHEN pt.topping_id = ANY(string_to_array(co.extras, ',')::INTEGER[]) THEN '2x' || pt.topping_name
                  ELSE pt.topping_name
              END AS ingredient_with_extra
    FROM      temp_customer_orders co CROSS JOIN LATERAL unnest(string_to_array((SELECT toppings FROM pizza_runner.pizza_recipes WHERE pizza_id = co.pizza_id), ',')::INTEGER[]) AS r(topping_id)
        JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pt USING(topping_id)
    GROUP BY  1, 2, 3, pt.topping_id, co.extras
),
AggregatedIngredients AS (
    SELECT   order_id,
             pizza_id,
             STRING_AGG(DISTINCT ingredient_with_extra, ', ' ORDER BY ingredient_with_extra) AS ingredients
    FROM     Ingredients
    GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT   ai.order_id,
         CONCAT(pn.pizza_name, ': ',  ai.ingredients) AS order_description
FROM     AggregatedIngredients ai JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn USING(pizza_id)
ORDER BY 1
```

**Explanation:**

- **Ingredients CTE**:

  - This part generates a list of all ingredients for each pizza, marking those that are also listed as extras with "2x".

  - The `CROSS JOIN LATERAL` with `unnest` is used to expand the toppings listed in `pizza_recipes` into individual rows, which are then joined with `pizza_toppings` to get the topping names.

  - Ingredients that are extras have "2x" prefixed directly.

- **AggregatedIngredients CTE**:

  - Aggregates the ingredients (including "2x" prefixed extras) for each order into a single, alphabetically ordered string.

  - `DISTINCT` inside `STRING_AGG` ensures no duplicate ingredient listings, addressing cases where an ingredient might be listed both as a base ingredient and an extra.

- **Final SELECT**: Constructs the final output by combining the pizza name with the aggregated ingredient list, ordered by `order_id`.

#### Result set:

| order_id | order_description                                                                                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Meatlovers: BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                    |
| 2        | Meatlovers: BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                    |
| 3        | Meatlovers: BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                    |
| 3        | Vegetarian: Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomato Sauce, Tomatoes                               |
| 4        | Meatlovers: BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                    |
| 4        | Vegetarian: Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomato Sauce, Tomatoes                               |
| 5        | Meatlovers: 2xBacon, BBQ Sauce, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                  |
| 6        | Vegetarian: Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomato Sauce, Tomatoes                               |
| 7        | Vegetarian: Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomato Sauce, Tomatoes                               |
| 8        | Meatlovers: BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                    |
| 9        | Meatlovers: 2xBacon, 2xChicken, BBQ Sauce, Beef, Cheese, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami                |
| 10       | Meatlovers: 2xBacon, 2xCheese, BBQ Sauce, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami |

### 6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

```sql
WITH BaseIngredients as (
    SELECT   pt.topping_id,
             COUNT(*) as base_count 
    FROM     pizza_runner.pizza_recipes pr JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pt ON pt.topping_id = ANY(string_to_array(pr.toppings, ',')::INTEGER[])
    GROUP BY 1
), Extras as (
    SELECT   unnest(string_to_array(co.extras, ',')::INTEGER[]) as topping_id,
             COUNT(*) as extra_count
    FROM     temp_customer_orders co
    WHERE    co.extras <> '' AND co.extras IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 1
), TotalIngredients as (
    SELECT   topping_id,
             (COALESCE(base_count, 0) + COALESCE(extra_count, 0)) as total_count
    FROM     BaseIngredients FULL OUTER JOIN Extras USING(topping_id)
)
SELECT   pt.topping_name,
         ti.total_count
FROM     TotalIngredients ti JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pt ON ti.topping_id = pt.topping_id
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

#### Result set:


topping_name |	total_count |
--|--|
Bacon |	5 |
Cheese |	3 |
Mushrooms |	2 |
Chicken |	2 |
Pepperoni |	1 |
Peppers |	1 |
Salami |	1 |
Tomatoes |	1 |
Tomato Sauce |	1 |
BBQ Sauce |	1 |
Beef |	1 |
Onions |	1 |
