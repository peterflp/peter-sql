## Solutions:

Let's collaborate on running the queries using `PostgreSQL v15` on [Pizza Metrics - DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/nAgbMx1ikUreFpfzCx6sM4/31).

### 1. How many pizzas were ordered?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(pizza_id) as total_pizzas_ordered
FROM   pizza_runner.customer_orders
```

#### Result set:

| total_pizzas_ordered |
| -------------------- |
| 14                   |

---

### 2. How many unique customer orders were made?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) as total_unique_orders
FROM   pizza_runner.customer_orders
```

#### Result set:

| total_unique_orders |
| ------------------- |
| 10                  |

---

### 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?

```sql
SELECT   runner_id, COUNT(order_id) as successful_orders
FROM     temp_runner_orders
WHERE    cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY 1
```

#### Result set:

| runner_id | successful_orders |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| 1         | 4                 |
| 2         | 3                 |
| 3         | 1                 |

---

### 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?

```sql
SELECT   pn.pizza_name, COUNT(order_id) as successful_orders
FROM     temp_runner_orders ro JOIN temp_customer_orders co USING(order_id)
							   JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn USING(pizza_id)
WHERE    cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY 1
```

#### Result set:

| pizza_name | successful_orders |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Vegetarian | 3                 |
| Meatlovers | 9                 |

---

### 5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?

```sql
SELECT   customer_id, pn.pizza_name, COUNT(order_id) as successful_orders
FROM     temp_runner_orders ro JOIN temp_customer_orders co USING(order_id)
							   JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn USING(pizza_id)
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:

| customer_id | pizza_name | successful_orders |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| 101         | Meatlovers | 2                 |
| 101         | Vegetarian | 1                 |
| 102         | Meatlovers | 2                 |
| 102         | Vegetarian | 1                 |
| 103         | Meatlovers | 3                 |
| 103         | Vegetarian | 1                 |
| 104         | Meatlovers | 3                 |
| 105         | Vegetarian | 1                 |

### 6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?

```sql
SELECT   order_id, COUNT(pizza_id)
FROM     temp_customer_orders co JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn USING(pizza_id)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc
LIMIT    1
```

#### Result set:

| order_id | count |
| -------- | ----- |
| 4        | 3     |

---

### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?

```sql
-- atleast one change --> exclusion or extras  <> null
-- no change --> exclusion or extras == null

SELECT   customer_id,
         SUM(CASE WHEN (exclusions IS NOT NULL OR extras IS NOT NULL) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS atleast_1_change,
         SUM(CASE WHEN (exclusions IS NULL AND extras IS NULL) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_change
FROM     temp_customer_orders JOIN temp_runner_orders USING (order_id)
WHERE    cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:

| customer_id | atleast_1_change | no_change |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| 101         | 0                | 2         |
| 102         | 0                | 3         |
| 103         | 3                | 0         |
| 104         | 2                | 1         |
| 105         | 1                | 0         |

### 8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?

```sql
SELECT   customer_id,
         SUM(CASE WHEN (exclusions IS NOT NULL AND extras IS NOT NULL) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS changes_in_both
FROM     temp_customer_orders JOIN temp_runner_orders USING (order_id)
WHERE    cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:

| customer_id | changes_in_both |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 101         | 0               |
| 102         | 0               |
| 103         | 0               |
| 104         | 1               |
| 105         | 0               |

### 9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?

```sql
SELECT   extract(hour from order_time) as hour_of_day,
		 COUNT(pizza_id)
FROM     temp_customer_orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:


hour_of_day |	count |
--|--|
11 |	1 |
13 |	3 |
18 |	3 |
19 |	1 |
21 |	3 |
23 |	3 |

---

### 10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?

```sql
-- dow (0-6, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday) 
-- isodow (1-7, where 1 is Monday and 7 is Sunday).

SELECT   extract(dow from order_time) as weekday,
		 COUNT(pizza_id)
FROM     temp_customer_orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1

-- or --

SELECT   extract(isodow from order_time) as weekday,
		 COUNT(pizza_id)
FROM     temp_customer_orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:

for `dow`: 

weekday |  count |
--|--|
3 |	5 |
4 |	3 |
5 |	1 |
