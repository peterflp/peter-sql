## Case Study Questions - Runner and Customer Experience

1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)

2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?

3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?

5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

## Solutions :

Let's collaborate on running the queries using `PostgreSQL v15` on [Runner & Customer Experience - DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/qXfAwWaJspvMVK4rwCNTie/26).

### 1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)

```sql
SELECT   EXTRACT(week from registration_date) as week_number,
	     COUNT(runner_id) as runners_count
FROM     pizza_runner.runners
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1


-- remarks :

-- Week Numbering: The ISO week date system is commonly used in many parts of the world. According to this system, the first week of the year is the week that contains the first Thursday of the year, and it is numbered as week 1. Weeks start on a Monday.

-- This system can lead to having either 52 or 53 weeks in a year. The 53rd week is possible in years where January 1st falls on a Friday in a common year or on a Thursday or Friday in a leap year. Hence, a week numbered 53 is entirely valid.
```

#### Result set:

| week_number | runners_count |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 1             |
| 53          | 2             |

---

### 2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?

```sql
SELECT   ro.runner_id,
		 ROUND(AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ro.pickup_time::TIMESTAMP - co.order_time)) / 60), 2) AS avg_time_to_pickup
FROM     temp_runner_orders ro JOIN temp_customer_orders co ON ro.order_id = co.order_id
WHERE    ro.pickup_time IS NOT NULL AND ro.cancellation IS NULL OR ro.cancellation = ''
GROUP BY 1


-- remarks :

-- The EPOCH is used within the EXTRACT function to convert a time interval into a total number of seconds.
-- then after dividing the number of seconds by 60, we can get the minutes.
```

#### Result set:

| runner_id | avg_time_to_pickup |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| 1         | 15.68              |
| 3         | 10.47              |
| 2         | 23.72              |

### 3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

```sql
WITH order_count as (
   SELECT   order_id,
            COUNT(order_id) AS pizzas_order_count,
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (pickup_time::TIMESTAMP - order_time)) / 60 AS preparation_time
   FROM     temp_runner_orders JOIN temp_customer_orders USING (order_id)
   WHERE    pickup_time IS NOT NULL AND cancellation IS NULL OR cancellation = ''
   GROUP BY 1, pickup_time, order_time)
SELECT   pizzas_order_count, round(AVG(preparation_time), 2) as time_for_prep
FROM     order_count
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:

| pizzas_order_count | time_for_prep |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| 1                  | 12.36         |
| 2                  | 18.38         |
| 3                  | 29.28         |

---

### 4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?

```sql
SELECT   customer_id,
         round(avg(distance)) AS avg_distance_travelled
FROM     temp_runner_orders JOIN temp_customer_orders USING (order_id)
WHERE    cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY 1
```

#### Result set:

| customer_id | avg_distance_travelled |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| 101         | 20                     |
| 102         | 17                     |
| 103         | 23                     |
| 104         | 10                     |
| 105         | 25                     |

### 5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

```sql
SELECT MAX(duration) - MIN(duration) AS maximum_difference
FROM   temp_runner_orders
```

#### Result set:


maximum_difference |
--|
30

---

### 6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

```sql
SELECT   runner_id, 
		 order_id,
         distance::numeric AS distance_km,
         round(duration::numeric/60, 2) AS duration_hr,
         round(distance::numeric*60/duration::numeric, 2) AS average_speed
FROM     temp_runner_orders
WHERE    cancellation IS NULL
ORDER BY 1, 2


-- remarks: 

-- 1. round function in PostgreSQL expects a numeric type for its first argument and an integer for its second argument
-- 2. given default duration is in minutes --> so in order to convert into hours (to get speed in km/hr), we divide the duration by 60. 
```

#### Result set:

runner_id |	order_id |	distance_in_km |	duration_in_hr |	average_speed |
--|--|--|--|--|
1 |	1 |	20 |	0.53 |	37.50 |
1 |	2 |	20 |	0.45 |	44.44 |
1 |	3 |	13.4 |	0.33 |	40.20 |
1 |	10 |	10 |	0.17 |	60.00 |
2 |	7 |	25 |	0.42 |	60.00
2 |	8 |	23.4 |	0.25 |	93.60 |
2 |	4 |	23.4 |	0.67 |	35.10 |
3 |	5 |	10 |	0.25 |	40.00 |

### 7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

```sql
SELECT   runner_id,
         COUNT(pickup_time) AS delivered_orders,
         COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
         ROUND(100 * COUNT(pickup_time) / COUNT(*)) AS delivery_success_percentage
FROM     temp_runner_orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:


runner_id |	delivered_orders |	total_orders |	delivery_success_percentage |
--|--|--|--|
1 |	4 |	4 |	100 |
2 |	3 |	4 |	75 |
3 |	1 |	2 |	50 |
