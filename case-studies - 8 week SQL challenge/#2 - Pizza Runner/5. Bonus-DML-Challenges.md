## Case Study Questions - Bonus Question

If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design?

Write an `INSERT` statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new Supreme pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?

## Solution :

Let's collaborate on running the queries using PostgreSQL on [Bonus DML Challenges - DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/bb3JgNR6WRCC1viTjFityZ/4). It'll be fantastic to team up and tackle the questions together!!

```sql
INSERT INTO pizza_names VALUES(3, 'Supreme');

SELECT * 
FROM   pizza_names;
```

#### Result set:

pizza_id |	pizza_name |
--|--|
1 |	Meatlovers |
2 |	Vegetarian |
3 |	Supreme |



```sql
INSERT INTO pizza_recipes
VALUES(3, (SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(topping_id SEPARATOR ', ') FROM pizza_toppings));

SELECT * 
FROM   pizza_recipes;
```

#### Result set:

pizza_id |	toppings |
--|--|
1 |	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 |
2 |	4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 |
3 |	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 |


```sql
SELECT *
FROM   pizza_names JOIN pizza_recipes USING(pizza_id);
```

#### Result set:


pizza_id |	pizza_name|	toppings |
--|--|--|
1 |	Meatlovers |	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 |
2 |	Vegetarian |	4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12 |
3 |	Supreme |	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 |
