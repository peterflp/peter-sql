## Introduction 
The 8 Week SQL Challenge is a series of case studies designed to help you improve your SQL skills. Each case study presents a real-world business scenario, and you are tasked with answering a series of questions using SQL queries.

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges, along with some explanations and any additional resources used.

## Case Studies Solutions 

The solutions for each case study are provided in the respective case study folder:

## Technologies Used 
- **SQL**: The primary language used for the challenges.

- **Database Management System**: PostgreSQL v15

## How to Use 
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have the necessary database management system and tools installed.
3. Navigate to the relevant folder for the case study you're interested in.
4. Explore the SQL files and DB Fiddle links provided in the markdown files.
   - Each markdown file contains a link to the corresponding `DB Fiddle`, which allows you to run the queries directly in the browser without setting up a local database.
5. (Optional) Run the queries in your preferred SQL client or database management tool.
