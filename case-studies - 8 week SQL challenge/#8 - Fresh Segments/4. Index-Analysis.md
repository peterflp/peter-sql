### Case Study Questions - Index Analysis


1. What is the top 10 interests by the average composition for each month?

2. For all of these top 10 interests - which interest appears the most often?

3. What is the average of the average composition for the top 10 interests for each month?

4. What is the 3 month rolling average of the max average composition value from September 2018 to August 2019 and include the previous top ranking interests in the same output shown below.

5. Provide a possible reason why the max average composition might change from month to month? Could it signal something is not quite right with the overall business model for Fresh Segments?

#### 1. What is the top 10 interests by the average composition for each month?


```sql
WITH get_top_avg_composition AS (
	SELECT   me.month_year,
		     me.interest_id,
		     ma.interest_name,
		     me.composition / me.index_value::numeric as avg_composition,
		     RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY month_year ORDER BY (me.composition / me.index_value)::numeric desc) as rn
	FROM     fresh_segments.interest_metrics me JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map ma
	ON       ma.id = me.interest_id::NUMERIC
	ORDER BY month_year, avg_composition DESC
)
SELECT   month_year, interest_name, avg_composition
FROM     get_top_avg_composition
WHERE    rn <= 10
ORDER BY month_year
LIMIT    10
```

#### Result set

*Query displaying only results for the first month (2018-07)*

| month_year  | interest_name                   | avg_composition |

#### 2. For all of these top 10 interests - which interest appears the most often?


```sql
WITH get_top_avg_composition AS (
	SELECT   me.month_year,
		     me.interest_id,
		     ma.interest_name,
		     ROUND((me.composition / me.index_value)::numeric, 2) as avg_composition,
		     RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY month_year ORDER BY (me.composition / me.index_value)::numeric desc) as rn
	FROM     fresh_segments.interest_metrics me JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map ma
	ON       ma.id = me.interest_id::NUMERIC
	ORDER BY month_year, avg_composition DESC
)
,get_top_ten as (
	SELECT   month_year, interest_name, avg_composition
	FROM     get_top_avg_composition
	WHERE    rn <= 10
)
SELECT   interest_name, COUNT(*)
FROM     get_top_ten
GROUP BY interest_name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) desc
LIMIT    5
```

#### Result set

#### 3. What is the average of the average composition for the top 10 interests for each month?


```sql
WITH get_top_avg_composition AS (
	SELECT   me.month_year,
		     me.interest_id,
		     ma.interest_name,
		     ROUND((me.composition / me.index_value)::numeric, 2) as avg_composition,
		     RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY month_year ORDER BY (me.composition / me.index_value)::numeric desc) as rn
	FROM     fresh_segments.interest_metrics me JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map ma
	ON       ma.id = me.interest_id::NUMERIC
	ORDER BY month_year, avg_composition DESC
)
SELECT   month_year, ROUND(avg(avg_composition), 2) AS monthly_cumulative_avg
FROM     get_top_avg_composition
WHERE    rn <= 10
GROUP BY month_year
```

#### Result set

#### 4. What is the 3 month rolling average of the max average composition value from September 2018 to August 2019 and include the previous top ranking interests in the same output shown below.

#### 5. Provide a possible reason why the max average composition might change from month to month? Could it signal something is not quite right with the overall business model for Fresh Segments?

--> This question can be left open to interpretation and can have many factors that influence the analysis.
