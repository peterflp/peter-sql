### Case Study Questions - Data Exploration and Cleaning


1. Update the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` table by modifying the month_year column to be a date data type with the start of the month.

2. What is count of records in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` for each `month_year` value sorted in chronological order (earliest to latest) with the null values appearing first?

3. What do you think we should do with these null values in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics`?

4. How many `interest_id` values exist in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` table but not in the `fresh_segments.interest_map` table? What about the other way around?

5. Summarise the id values in the `fresh_segments.interest_map` by its total record count in this table

6. What sort of table join should we perform for our analysis and why? Check your logic by checking the rows where interest_id = 21246 in your joined output and include all columns from `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` and all columns from `fresh_segments.interest_map` except from the id column.

7. Are there any records in your joined table where the month_year value is before the created_at value from the `fresh_segments.interest_map` table? Do you think these values are valid and why?

### Solutions

#### 1. Update the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` table by modifying the month_year column to be a date data type with the start of the month.

```sql
ALTER TABLE fresh_segments.interest_metrics
ALTER COLUMN month_year TYPE DATE
USING TO_DATE(
  CASE
    WHEN month_year LIKE '%LL%' THEN NULL
    ELSE REPLACE(month_year, 'NU', '01')
  END,
  'MM-YYYY'
);
```

-- OR --

```sql
-- Alter the length of VARCHAR
ALTER TABLE fresh_segments.interest_metrics 
ALTER COLUMN month_year TYPE VARCHAR(15);

-- Convert to date format
UPDATE fresh_segments.interest_metrics
SET month_year = TO_DATE(month_year, 'MM-YYYY')

-- Alter table column type to date
ALTER TABLE fresh_segments.interest_metrics
ALTER month_year TYPE DATE USING month_year::DATE

SELECT *
FROM   fresh_segments.interest_metrics
LIMIT   10
```


---

#### 2. What is count of records in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` for each `month_year` value sorted in chronological order (earliest to latest) with the null values appearing first?


```sql
SELECT   month_year, COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM     fresh_segments.interest_metrics
GROUP BY month_year
ORDER BY month_year NULLS FIRST
```

month_year |	record_count |
--|--|
[null] |	1194 |
2018-07-01 |	729 |
2018-08-01 |	767 |
2018-09-01 |	780 |
2018-10-01 |	857 |
2018-11-01 |	928 |
2018-12-01 |	995 |
2019-01-01 |	973 |
2019-02-01 |	1121 |
2019-03-01 |	1136 |
2019-04-01 |	1099 |
2019-05-01 |	857 |
2019-06-01 |	824 |
2019-07-01 |	864 |
2019-08-01 |	1149 |

#### 3. What do you think we should do with these null values in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics`?


The null values in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` table could be problematic for analysis, as they represent missing data. 

Depending on the context and the importance of the data, we could consider the following options:


- Impute the missing values using appropriate techniques (e.g., mean/median imputation, interpolation, or machine learning-based imputation) if the missing data is not random and can be estimated reliably.

- Remove the rows with null values if they are not critical to the analysis and the remaining data is still representative.

- Flag the rows with null values and treat them differently in the analysis, depending on the business requirements.

**Answer:** 

Checking for NULL values:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as null_count
FROM   fresh_segments.interest_metrics
WHERE  month_year IS NULL
```

null_count |
--|
1194 | 


Deleting records with NULL month_year values.


```sql
DELETE FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
WHERE  month_year IS NULL;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_count
FROM   fresh_segments.interest_metrics
WHERE  month_year IS NULL;
```

null_count |
--|
0 |

#### 4. How many `interest_id` values exist in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` table but not in the `fresh_segments.interest_map` table? What about the other way around?


```sql
SELECT 'metric_not_map' as description, COUNT(me.interest_id)
FROM   fresh_segments.interest_metrics me LEFT JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map ma ON me.interest_id::numeric=ma.id
WHERE  ma.id IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT 'map_not_metric', COUNT(ma.id)
FROM   fresh_segments.interest_map ma LEFT JOIN fresh_segments.interest_metrics me ON me.interest_id::numeric=ma.id
WHERE  me.interest_id IS NULL
```

description |	count |
--|--|
metric_not_map |	0 |
map_not_metric |	7 |

---

#### 5. Summarise the id values in the `fresh_segments.interest_map` by its total record count in this table


```sql
SELECT id_count, COUNT(*) as total_id
FROM  (
	SELECT   id, COUNT(*) as id_count
	FROM     fresh_segments.interest_map 
	GROUP BY id
)
GROUP BY id_count
```

id_count | total_id
--|--|
1 | 1209 |

---

#### 6. What sort of table join should we perform for our analysis and why? Check your logic by checking the rows where interest_id = 21246 in your joined output and include all columns from `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` and all columns from `fresh_segments.interest_map` except from the id column.


```sql
-- all values of interest_id from interest_metrics are also in interest_map
-- all id's in interest_map are unique.

-- so INNER or LEFT JOIN would suffice


SELECT COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM   fresh_segments.interest_map;

SELECT *
FROM   fresh_segments.interest_metrics me JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map ma 
ON     me.interest_id::numeric=ma.id
WHERE  id='21246'
```

### 7. 

a. Are there any records in your joined table where the month_year value is before the created_at value from the `fresh_segments.interest_map` table? 


```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM   fresh_segments.interest_metrics me JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map ma 
ON     me.interest_id::numeric=ma.id
WHERE  ma.created_at > me.month_year
```

count |
--|
188 |


b. Do you think these values are valid and why?

Yes, the previous query shows that we do have many records. 

However these records appear to be created monthly. Since we rolled the dates back to the beginning of the month, as long as the `month_year` month is equal to or greater than `created_at`, the record should be considered valid.

This can be crossed referenced by comparing the `created_at` value with the `month_year` value.

```sql
WITH CTE as (
  SELECT me.*,
         ma.interest_name,
         ma.interest_summary,
         ma.created_at,
         ma.last_modified
  FROM   fresh_segments.interest_metrics me JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map ma 
  ON     me.interest_id::numeric = ma.id
  WHERE  me.month_year IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM   CTE
WHERE  month_year < DATE_TRUNC('mon', created_at);
```
