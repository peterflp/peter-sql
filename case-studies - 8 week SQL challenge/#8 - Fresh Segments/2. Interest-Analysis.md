### Case Study Questions - Interest Analysis


1. Which interests have been present in all month_year dates in our dataset?

2. Using this same total_months measure - calculate the cumulative percentage of all records starting at 14 months - which total_months value passes the 90% cumulative percentage value?

3. If we were to remove all interest_id values which are lower than the total_months value we found in the previous question - how many total data points would we be removing?

4. Does this decision make sense to remove these data points from a business perspective? Use an example where there are all 14 months present to a removed interest example for your arguments - think about what it means to have less months present from a segment perspective.

5. After removing these interests - how many unique interests are there for each month?

### Solutions

#### 1. Which interests have been present in all month_year dates in our dataset?

asking for 'which' interests, but difficult to paste the result set, so getting 'how many',
so, originally just keep the CTE query.

```sql
WITH CTE as (
	SELECT   interest_id
	FROM     fresh_segments.interest_metrics
	WHERE    interest_id IS NOT NULL
	GROUP BY interest_id
	HAVING   COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics)
)
SELECT COUNT(interest_id)
FROM   CTE
```

#### Result set:

count |
--|
480 |

---

#### 2. Using this same total_months measure - calculate the cumulative percentage of all records starting at 14 months - which total_months value passes the 90% cumulative percentage value?


```sql
WITH get_total_months as (
	SELECT   interest_id, COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) as total_months
	FROM     fresh_segments.interest_metrics
	WHERE    interest_id IS NOT NULL
	GROUP BY interest_id
)
,get_cumulative_percentage as (
	SELECT   total_months, 
	         COUNT(*) as id_count,
		     ROUND(100 * SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(ORDER BY total_months desc) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as cumulative_percentage
	FROM     get_total_months
	GROUP BY total_months
	ORDER BY total_months desc
)
SELECT total_months, id_count, cumulative_percentage
FROM   get_cumulative_percentage
WHERE  cumulative_percentage >= 90
```

#### Result set:

total_months |	id_count |	cumulative_percentage |
--|--|--|
6 |	33 |	90.85 |
5 |	38 |	94.01 |
4 |	32 |	96.67 |
3 |	15 |	97.92 |
2 |	12 |	98.92 |
1 |	13 |	100.00 |

#### 3. If we were to remove all interest_id values which are lower than the total_months value we found in the previous question - how many total data points would we be removing?


```sql
WITH get_total_months AS (
    SELECT   interest_id, COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) as total_months
    FROM     fresh_segments.interest_metrics
    GROUP BY interest_id
    HAVING   COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) < 6
)
SELECT COUNT(*) as rows_removed
FROM   fresh_segments.interest_metrics
WHERE  EXISTS(
    SELECT interest_id
    FROM   get_total_months
    WHERE  get_total_months.interest_id = fresh_segments.interest_metrics.interest_id
);
```

#### Result set:

rows_removed |
--|
400 |

#### 4. Does this decision make sense to remove these data points from a business perspective? Use an example where there are all 14 months present to a removed interest example for your arguments - think about what it means to have less months present from a segment perspective.


There could be some very good reasons for wanting to remove the data points with less than 6 months. These could mean that the data is incomplete, newly implemented or inconsistent. 

However, there should be no right or wrong answer unless we understand the business specific question we are attempting to answer.

#### 5. After removing these interests - how many unique interests are there for each month?


```sql
WITH get_interest_rank AS (
  SELECT me.month_year,
         ma.interest_name,
         me.composition,
         RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY ma.interest_name ORDER BY composition desc) as rn
  FROM   fresh_segments.interest_metrics me JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map ma 
  ON     me.interest_id::numeric = ma.id
  WHERE  me.month_year IS NOT NULL
)
,get_top_10 as (
  SELECT   month_year, interest_name, composition
  FROM     get_interest_rank
  WHERE    rn=1
  ORDER BY composition DESC
  LIMIT    10
)
SELECT   * 
FROM     get_top_10
ORDER BY composition desc
```

#### Result set:

month_year |	interest_name |	composition |
--|--|--|
2018-12-01 |	Work Comes First Travelers |	21.2 |
2018-07-01 |	Gym Equipment Owners |	18.82 |
2018-07-01 |	Furniture Shoppers |	17.44 |
2018-07-01 |	Luxury Retail Shoppers |	17.19 |
2018-10-01 |	Luxury Boutique Hotel Researchers |	15.15 |
2018-12-01 |	Luxury Bedding Shoppers |	15.05 |
2018-07-01 |	Shoe Shoppers |	14.91 |
2018-07-01 |	Cosmetics and Beauty Shoppers |	14.23 |
2018-07-01 |	Luxury Hotel Guests |	14.1 |
2018-07-01 |	Luxury Retail Researchers |	13.97 |
