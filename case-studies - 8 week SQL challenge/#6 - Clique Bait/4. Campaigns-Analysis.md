## Case Study Questions - Campaign Analysis

Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:


- `user_id`

- `visit_id`

- `visit_start_time`: the earliest `event_time` for each visit

- `page_views`: count of page views for each visit

- `cart_adds`: count of product cart add events for each visit

- `purchase`: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit

- `campaign_name`: map the visit to a campaign if the `visit_start_time` falls between the `start_date` and `end_date`

- `impression`: count of ad impressions for each visit

- `click`: count of ad clicks for each visit

- (Optional column) `cart_products`: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the `sequence_number`)



Use the subsequent dataset to generate at least 5 insights for the Clique Bait team - bonus: prepare a `single A4 infographic` that the team can use for their management reporting sessions, be sure to emphasise the most important points from your findings.

Some ideas you might want to investigate further include:


- Identifying users who have received impressions during each campaign period and comparing each metric with other users who did not have an impression event

- Does clicking on an impression lead to higher purchase rates?

- What is the uplift in purchase rate when comparing users who click on a campaign impression versus users who do not receive an impression? What if we compare them with users who just an impression but do not click?

- What metrics can you use to quantify the success or failure of each campaign compared to eachother?



## Solution / Deliverables:

Let's collaborate on running the queries using PostgreSQL on [Campaign Analysis - DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/9enwwaR9NeS8ZB6Qy1QX6R/1).

```sql
WITH visit_details AS (
  SELECT   e.visit_id,
           u.user_id,
           MIN(e.event_time) AS visit_start_time,
           COUNT(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 END) AS page_views,
           COUNT(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 END) AS cart_adds,
           MAX(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase,
           COUNT(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 4 THEN 1 END) AS impression,
           COUNT(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 5 THEN 1 END) AS click,
           STRING_AGG(CAST(ph.product_id AS VARCHAR), ', ' ORDER BY e.sequence_number) AS cart_products
  FROM     clique_bait.events e JOIN clique_bait.users u USING(cookie_id)
                                LEFT JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy ph USING(page_id)
  GROUP BY 1, 2
),
campaign_details AS (
  SELECT vd.visit_id, 
         ci.campaign_name
  FROM   visit_details vd LEFT JOIN clique_bait.campaign_identifier ci 
                          ON vd.visit_start_time BETWEEN ci.start_date AND ci.end_date
)
SELECT vd.user_id,
       vd.visit_id,
       vd.visit_start_time,
       vd.page_views,
       vd.cart_adds,
       vd.purchase,
       cd.campaign_name,
       vd.impression,
       vd.click,
       vd.cart_products
FROM   visit_details vd LEFT JOIN campaign_details cd ON vd.visit_id = cd.visit_id
```
