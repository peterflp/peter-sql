## Solutions:

Let's collaborate on running the queries using PostgreSQL on [Digital Analysis - DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/kmDWHqX7fSAwnP6wbfvo5H/13).

---

### 1. How many users are there?


```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
FROM   clique_bait.users
```

#### Result set:

count | 
--| 
500 | 

---

### 2. How many cookies does each user have on average?


```sql
WITH cookie_cte as (
    SELECT   user_id, COUNT(cookie_id) as count
    FROM     clique_bait.users
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(count)) as avg_cookies
FROM   cookie_cte
```

#### Result set:

avg_cookies |
--|
4 | 

---

### 3. What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?


```sql
SELECT   EXTRACT(month from event_time) as month_number, COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id)
FROM     clique_bait.events
GROUP BY 1
```

#### Result set:

month_number |	count |
--|--|
1 |	876 |
2 |	1488 |
3 |	916 |
4 |	248 |
5 |	36 |

---

### 4. What is the number of events for each event type?



```sql
SELECT   event_type, COUNT(*) 
FROM     clique_bait.events
GROUP BY 1
```

#### Result set:

event_type |	count |
--|--|
3 |	1777 |
5 |	702 |
4 |	876 |
2 |	8451 |
1 |	20928 |

---

### 5. What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?



```sql
SELECT ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT e.visit_id)/
    				(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) 
                     FROM   clique_bait.events)
             , 2)  AS percentage_purchase
FROM   clique_bait.events AS ev JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier AS ei USING(event_type)
WHERE  ei.event_name = 'Purchase'
```

#### Result set:

percentage_purchase |
--|
49.00 | 

---

### 6. What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?


```sql
WITH checkout_purchase_cte AS (
    SELECT   visit_id,
             MAX(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 AND page_id = 12 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as checkout,
             MAX(CASE WHEN event_type = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as purchase
    FROM     clique_bait.events
    GROUP BY 1)
SELECT ROUND(100 * (1-(SUM(purchase)::numeric/SUM(checkout))),2) as percentage_checkout_view_with_no_purchase
FROM   checkout_purchase_cte
```

#### Result set:

percentage_checkout_view_with_no_purchase | 
--|
15.50 | 

---

### 7. What are the top 3 pages by number of views?


```sql
SELECT   ph.page_name, COUNT(*) AS page_views
FROM     clique_bait.events AS e JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy AS ph USING(page_id)
WHERE    e.event_type = 1 
GROUP BY ph.page_name
ORDER BY page_views DESC 
LIMIT    3
```

#### Result set:

page_name |	page_views |
--|--|
All Products |	3174 |
Checkout |	2103 |
Home Page |	1782 |


---

### 8. What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?


```sql
SELECT   ph.product_category, 
  		 SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_views,
  		 SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_adds
FROM     clique_bait.events AS e JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy AS ph USING(page_id)
WHERE    ph.product_category IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

#### Result set:

product_category |	page_views |	cart_adds |
--|--|--|
Shellfish |	6204 |	3792 |
Fish |	4633 |	2789 |
Luxury |	3032 |	1870 |

---

### 9. What are the top 3 products by purchases?


```sql
SELECT   ph.product_id, 
         COUNT(*) AS purchase_count
FROM     clique_bait.events AS e JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy AS ph USING(page_id)
WHERE    e.event_type = 3 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT    3;
```

#### Result set:

product_id |	purchase_count |
--|--|
null |	1777 |
