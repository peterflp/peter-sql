## Case Study Questions - Product Funnel Analysis

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:


- How many times was each product viewed?

- How many times was each product added to cart?

- How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?

- How many times was each product purchased?

Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:


1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?

2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?

3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?

4. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?

5. What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?

## Solutions:

Let's collaborate on running the queries using PostgreSQL on [Product Funnel Analysis - DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/gF6ev3SdP8L4DrWzxRPQ5f/13).

`Table 1` : (first part of question)

```sql
WITH product_page_events AS (
  SELECT   e.visit_id,
           ph.product_id,
           ph.page_name AS product_name,
           ph.product_category,
           SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_view,
           SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_add
  FROM     clique_bait.events AS e JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy as ph USING(page_id)
  WHERE    product_id IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 4
),
purchase_events AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT visit_id
  FROM   clique_bait.events
  WHERE  event_type = 3 
),
combined_table AS ( 
  SELECT ppe.visit_id, 
         ppe.product_id, 
         ppe.product_name, 
         ppe.product_category, 
         ppe.page_view, 
         ppe.cart_add,
         CASE WHEN pe.visit_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as purchase
  FROM   product_page_events as ppe LEFT JOIN purchase_events as pe USING(visit_id)
),
product_info AS (
  SELECT   product_name, 
           product_category, 
           SUM(page_view) AS views,
           SUM(cart_add) AS cart_adds, 
           SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS abandoned,
           SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchases
  FROM     combined_table
  GROUP BY product_id, product_name, product_category)
SELECT   *
FROM     product_info
ORDER BY product_name;
```

#### Result set:

product_name |	product_category |	views |	cart_adds |	abandoned |	purchases |
--|--|--|--|--|--|
Abalone |	Shellfish|	1525 |	932 |	233 |	699 |
Black Truffle |	Luxury |	1469 |	924 |	217 |	707 |
Crab |	Shellfish |	1564 |	949 |	230 |	719 |
Kingfish |	Fish |	1559 |	920 |	213 |	707 |
Lobster |	Shellfish |	1547 |	968 |	214 |	754 |
Oyster |	Shellfish |	1568 |	943 |	217 |	726 |
Russian Caviar |	Luxury |	1563 |	946 |	249 |	697 |
Salmon |	Fish |	1559 |	938 |	227 |	711 |
Tuna |	Fish |	1515 |	931 |	234 |	697 |

`Table 2` : 

Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

```sql
WITH product_page_events AS (
  SELECT 
    e.visit_id,
    ph.product_id,
    ph.page_name AS product_name,
    ph.product_category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_view,
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_add 
  FROM clique_bait.events AS e
  JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy AS ph
    ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
  WHERE product_id IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY e.visit_id, ph.product_id, ph.page_name, ph.product_category
),
purchase_events AS ( 
  SELECT 
    DISTINCT visit_id
  FROM clique_bait.events
  WHERE event_type = 3 
),
combined_table AS ( 
  SELECT 
    ppe.visit_id, 
    ppe.product_id, 
    ppe.product_name, 
    ppe.product_category, 
    ppe.page_view, 
    ppe.cart_add,
    CASE WHEN pe.visit_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS purchase
  FROM product_page_events AS ppe
  LEFT JOIN purchase_events AS pe
    ON ppe.visit_id = pe.visit_id
),
product_category AS (
  SELECT 
    product_category, 
    SUM(page_view) AS views,
    SUM(cart_add) AS cart_adds, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS abandoned,
    SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchases
  FROM combined_table
  GROUP BY product_category)

SELECT *
FROM product_category
```

#### Result set:

product_category |	views |	cart_adds |	abandoned |	purchases |
--|--|--|--|--|
Luxury |	3032 |	1870 |	466 |	1404 |
Shellfish |	6204 |	3792 |	894 |	2898 |
Fish |	4633 |	2789 |	674 |	2115 |

### 1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?



```sql
-- refer table 1 - result set
```

#### Result set:

- Oyster has the most views.

- Lobster has the most cart adds as well as purchases.

---

### 2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?



```sql
-- refer table 1 - result set
```

#### Result set:

Russian Caviar is most likely to be abandoned.


---

### 3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?



```sql
SELECT   product_name, 
         product_category, 
         ROUND(100 * purchases/views,2) AS purchase_per_view_percentage
FROM     product_info
ORDER BY 3 DESC
```

#### Result set:



---

### 4. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?

---

### 5. What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?
