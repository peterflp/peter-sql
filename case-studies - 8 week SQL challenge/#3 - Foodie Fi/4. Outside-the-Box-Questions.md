### 1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?

To calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi, we can track the number of new customers acquired over time.

```sql
SELECT   EXTRACT(month from start_date),
         COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as new_customers_acquired
FROM     foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE    plan_id <> 4
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:

| month_number | new_customers_acquired |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| 1            | 146                    |
| 2            | 114                    |
| 3            | 138                    |
| 4            | 129                    |
| 5            | 128                    |
| 6            | 123                    |
| 7            | 132                    |
| 8            | 152                    |
| 9            | 140                    |
| 10           | 146                    |
| 11           | 123                    |
| 12           | 133                    |

Another thing that we can do to calculate the growth is calculate the `month-over-month growth rate` :

```sql
WITH monthly_customers as (
    SELECT   EXTRACT(month from start_date) as month_number,
             COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as new_customers_acquired
    FROM     foodie_fi.subscriptions
    WHERE    plan_id <> 4
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT   month_number,
         new_customers_acquired,
         ROUND(100.0 * (new_customers_acquired - LAG(new_customers_acquired) OVER(ORDER BY month_number)) /
                        NULLIF(LAG(new_customers_acquired) OVER(ORDER BY month_number), 0)
                ,2) as month_over_month_growth_rate
FROM     monthly_customers
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:

| month_number | new_customers_acquired | month_over_month_growth_rate |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1            | 146                    | null                         |
| 2            | 114                    | -21.92                       |
| 3            | 138                    | 21.05                        |
| 4            | 129                    | -6.52                        |
| 5            | 128                    | -0.78                        |
| 6            | 123                    | -3.91                        |
| 7            | 132                    | 7.32                         |
| 8            | 152                    | 15.15                        |
| 9            | 140                    | -7.89                        |
| 10           | 146                    | 4.29                         |
| 11           | 123                    | -15.75                       |
| 12           | 133                    | 8.13                         |

### 2. What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?

Some key-metrics include :

1. **Customer Acquisition Rate**:

```sql
WITH new_customers as (
    SELECT   EXTRACT(month from start_date) as month_number,
             COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as new_customers_acquired
    FROM     foodie_fi.subscriptions
    WHERE    plan_id <> 4
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT   month_number,
         new_customers_acquired,
         LEAD(new_customers) OVER (ORDER BY month) - new_customers AS customer_acquisition
FROM     new_customers
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:

| month_number | new_customers_acquired | customer_acquisition |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1            | 146                    | -32                  |
| 2            | 114                    | 24                   |
| 3            | 138                    | -9                   |
| 4            | 129                    | -1                   |
| 5            | 128                    | -5                   |
| 6            | 123                    | 9                    |
| 7            | 132                    | 20                   |
| 8            | 152                    | -12                  |
| 9            | 140                    | 6                    |
| 10           | 146                    | -23                  |
| 11           | 123                    | 10                   |
| 12           | 133                    | null                 |

---

2. **Revenue Growth**:

```sql
WITH monthly_revenue AS (
    SELECT   EXTRACT(month from start_date) AS month,
             COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id) AS active_customers,
             SUM(p.price) AS revenue
    FROM     foodie_fi.subscriptions s JOIN foodie_fi.plans p USING(plan_id)
    WHERE    p.plan_id <> 4
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT   month,
         revenue,
         revenue - LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month)  AS revenue_growth
FROM     monthly_revenue
ORDER BY 1
```

This query first calculates the total revenue generated each month by summing the prices of all active subscriptions (excluding the 'churn' plan). It then calculates the revenue growth by taking the difference between the current month's revenue and the previous month's revenue.

#### Result set:

| month | revenue | revenue_growth |
| ----- | ------- | -------------- |
| 1     | 6654.60 | null           |
| 2     | 5560.20 | -1094.40       |
| 3     | 4703.90 | -856.30        |
| 4     | 5957.90 | 1254.00        |
| 5     | 3887.80 | -2070.10       |
| 6     | 4465.00 | 577.20         |
| 7     | 5211.60 | 746.60         |
| 8     | 6425.00 | 1213.40        |
| 9     | 6386.00 | -39.00         |
| 10    | 7758.70 | 1372.70        |
| 11    | 5101.90 | -2656.80       |
| 12    | 5360.90 | 259.00         |

---

3. **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**:

```sql
WITH monthly_arpu AS (
    SELECT   EXTRACT(month from start_date) AS month,
             COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id) AS active_customers,
             SUM(p.price) AS revenue
    FROM     foodie_fi.subscriptions s JOIN foodie_fi.plans p USING(plan_id)
    WHERE    p.plan_id <> 4
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT   month,
         ROUND(revenue / active_customers, 2) AS arpu
FROM     monthly_arpu
ORDER BY 1
```

This query first counts the active customers and calculates the total revenue for each month. It then divides the revenue by the active customers to calculate the average revenue per user (ARPU) for each month.

#### Result set:

| month | arpu  |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1     | 45.58 |
| 2     | 48.77 |
| 3     | 34.09 |
| 4     | 46.19 |
| 5     | 30.37 |
| 6     | 36.30 |
| 7     | 39.48 |
| 8     | 42.27 |
| 9     | 45.61 |
| 10    | 53.14 |
| 11    | 41.48 |
| 12    | 40.31 |

---

4. **Subscription Plan Adoption**:

```sql
SELECT   p.plan_name,
         COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id) AS customers
FROM     foodie_fi.subscriptions s JOIN foodie_fi.plans p USING(plan_id)
WHERE    p.plan_id <> 4
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc
```

#### Result set:

| plan_name     | customers |
| ------------- | --------- |
| trial         | 1000      |
| basic monthly | 546       |
| pro monthly   | 539       |
| pro annual    | 258       |

Some other metrics could include the likes of :

- Customer Retention Rate

- Customer Churn Rate

### 3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?

Sure, here are some key customer journeys or experiences that could be analyzed further to improve customer retention, along with the corresponding SQL queries:

A. **Trial to Paid Conversion**:

1. `Count of customers who converted from trial to paid plans`:

```sql
WITH trial_customers AS (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_trial_customers
  FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
  WHERE plan_id = 0
)
SELECT
  ROUND(
    100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id) / (SELECT total_trial_customers FROM trial_customers),
    2
  ) AS conversion_rate
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
WHERE s.customer_id IN (
  SELECT customer_id
  FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
  WHERE plan_id = 0
) AND s.plan_id IN (1, 2, 3);
```

#### Result set:

| conversion_rate |
| --------------- |
| 90.80           |

2. `Conversion rates by paid plan type`

```sql
WITH trial_customers AS (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_trial_customers
  FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions
  WHERE  plan_id = 0
)
SELECT   p.plan_name,
         ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id) / (SELECT total_trial_customers FROM trial_customers)
                ,2) AS conversion_rate
FROM     foodie_fi.subscriptions s JOIN foodie_fi.plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE    s.customer_id IN (
            SELECT customer_id
            FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions
            WHERE  plan_id = 0
            ) and p.plan_id IN (1, 2, 3)
GROUP BY 1;
```

#### Result set:

| plan_name     | conversion_rate |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| basic monthly | 54.60           |
| pro annual    | 25.80           |
| pro monthly   | 53.90           |

3. `Average days to convert from trial to paid plans`

```sql
WITH trial_to_paid AS (
  SELECT s1.customer_id,
         s1.plan_id AS trial_plan,
         s2.plan_id AS paid_plan,
         s2.start_date - s1.start_date AS days_to_convert
  FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions s1 JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions s2 USING(customer_id) and s2.start_date > s1.start_date
  WHERE  s1.plan_id = 0 AND s2.plan_id IN (1, 2, 3)
)
SELECT  p.plan_name,
        ROUND(AVG(days_to_convert), 2) AS avg_days_to_convert
FROM     trial_to_paid t JOIN foodie_fi.plans p USING(plan_id)
GROUP BY 1
```

#### Result set:

| plan_name     | avg_days_to_convert |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| basic monthly | 7.00                |
| pro annual    | 104.62              |
| pro monthly   | 43.03               |

---

B. **Long-term Retention**:

1. `Count of customers on pro annual plan for more than 1 year`

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS long_term_pro_annual_customers
FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE  plan_id = 3 and DATE_PART('year', AGE(CURRENT_DATE, start_date)) >= 1;
```

#### Result set:

| long_term_pro_annual_customers |
| ------------------------------ |

SELECT ROUND(AVG(DATE_PART('year', AGE(CURRENT_DATE, start_date)))::numeric, 2) AS avg_tenure_years
FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE  plan_id = 3;
```

#### Result set:

| avg_tenure_years |
| ---------------- |
| 3.01             |


3. `Retention rate of pro annual customers after 1 year`

```sql
WITH pro_annual_customers AS (
  SELECT customer_id, start_date
  FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions
  WHERE  plan_id = 3
)
SELECT ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN DATE_PART('year', AGE(CURRENT_DATE, start_date)) >= 1 THEN 1 END) / 
                    COUNT(*), 2) AS retention_rate_after_1yr
FROM   pro_annual_customers;
```

#### Result set:

### 4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?


If I were to create an exit survey for customers canceling their Foodie-Fi subscription, I would include questions to understand why they are leaving and what improvements could bring them back. 

Some key questions would be:

- Why are you canceling? (too expensive, missing features, poor customer service, etc.)

- How would you rate the value for money?
- What was your overall experience with the product? 
- Would you consider returning if certain changes were made?
- Any other feedback on how we could improve?

Getting this feedback directly from churning customers can provide valuable insights into what Foodie-Fi is doing well and where they need to focus their efforts to retain more customers long-term. .

### 5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?


To reduce customer churn at Foodie-Fi, some potential business levers they could use include:

`Pricing & Packaging Adjustments`
- Offer more flexible pricing plans or tiers to better match customer needs/budgets

- Provide discounts for longer commitment periods (e.g. annual vs monthly pricing)
- Add a free trial or freemium model to reduce friction to sign up

`Product Improvements`
- Gather feedback on requested features and prioritize adding high-impact ones

- Improve user experience through design/UI updates
- Enhance personalization and content recommendations  

`Better Customer Support`
- Offer more support channels like live chat, phone line, etc.

- Provide self-service help docs, FAQs, tutorials
- Track and resolve customer issues more quickly

To validate if those strategies are actually effective at reducing churn, some things I would look at include:

- `Metrics` like churn rate, customer lifetime value, net revenue retention over time as changes are made

- `Cohort analysis` on different customer segments and how their churn rates change
- `Surveys` to understand if customer satisfaction, perceived value is improving
- `Product usage data` to see if engagement/activation is increasing after improvements

It would be an iterative process of implementing changes, closely monitoring the impact on key metrics, and getting direct user feedback to determine what's working and what else needs adjusting.
