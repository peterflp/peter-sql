## Solutions:

Let's collaborate on running the queries using PostgreSQL on [Data Analysis - DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/aCdVqr1kA2SkyZz3JVZptK/36).

---

### 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as total_customers
FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions
```

#### Result set:

| total_customers |
| --------------- |
| 1000            |

---

### 2. What is the monthly distribution of `trial` plan `start_date` values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value

```sql
SELECT   extract(month from start_date) as month_number,
	     COUNT(s.customer_id) as trial_subscriptions
FROM     foodie_fi.plans p JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions s USING(plan_id)
WHERE    p.plan_name='trial'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:

| month_number | trial_subscriptions |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| 1            | 88                  |
| 2            | 68                  |
| 3            | 94                  |
| 4            | 81                  |
| 5            | 88                  |
| 6            | 79                  |
| 7            | 89                  |
| 8            | 88                  |
| 9            | 87                  |
| 10           | 79                  |
| 11           | 75                  |
| 12           | 84                  |

---

### 3. What plan `start_date` values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each `plan_name`

```sql
SELECT   p.plan_name,
	     COUNT(*) as count
FROM     foodie_fi.plans p JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions s USING(plan_id)
WHERE    extract(year from start_date) > '2020'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2
```

#### Result set:

| plan_name     | count |
| ------------- | ----- |
| basic monthly | 8     |
| pro monthly   | 60    |
| pro annual    | 63    |
| churn         | 71    |

---

### 4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?

```sql
-- approach 1: using CTE (easy to understand)

WITH total_customers AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customer_count
    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
),
churned_customers AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS churned_customer_count
    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
    JOIN foodie_fi.plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
    WHERE p.plan_name = 'churn'
)
SELECT
    churned_customer_count AS churned_customers,
    ROUND((100.0 * churned_customer_count) / total_customer_count, 1) AS churned_percentage
FROM total_customers, churned_customers;


-- approach 2: using subquery (short)

SELECT   COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as churned_customers,
		 ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) / (
                 SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
                 FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions), 1) AS "churn percentage"

FROM     foodie_fi.plans p JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions s USING(plan_id)
WHERE    p.plan_name='churn'
```

#### Result set:

| churned_customers | churned_percentage |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| 307               | 30.7               |

---

### 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?

```sql
WITH customer_journeys AS (
  SELECT  s.customer_id,
          p.plan_name,
	      LEAD(p.plan_name) OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.start_date) AS next_plan
  FROM    foodie_fi.subscriptions s JOIN foodie_fi.plans p USING(plan_id)
)
SELECT COUNT(customer_id) AS churned_customers,
       ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(customer_id) /
                     (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions)
            ) AS churn_percentage
FROM   customer_journeys
WHERE  plan_name = 'trial' and next_plan = 'churn'
```

#### Result set:

| churned_customers | churn_percentage |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 92                | 9                |

---

### 6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?

```sql
WITH customer_journeys AS (
  SELECT  s.customer_id,
          p.plan_name,
	      LEAD(p.plan_name) OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.start_date) AS next_plan
  FROM    foodie_fi.subscriptions s JOIN foodie_fi.plans p USING(plan_id)
)
SELECT   next_plan as plan_name,
         COUNT(customer_id) AS conversion_count,
         ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(customer_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions)
              ) AS conversion_percentage
FROM     customer_journeys
WHERE    plan_name = 'trial' and next_plan IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

#### Result set:

| plan_name     | conversion_count | conversion_percentage |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| basic monthly | 546              | 55                    |
| pro monthly   | 325              | 33                    |
| churn         | 92               | 9                     |
| pro annual    | 37               | 4                     |

---

### 7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 `plan_name` values at `2020-12-31`?

```sql
WITH next_dates AS (
  SELECT customer_id,
         plan_name,
  	     start_date,
         LEAD(start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS next_date
  FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions s JOIN foodie_fi.plans p USING(plan_id)
  WHERE  start_date <= '2020-12-31'
)
SELECT   plan_name,
	       COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count,
         ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) /
              		(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions)
  		   ,1) AS percentage
FROM     next_dates
WHERE    next_date IS NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

#### Result set:

| plan_name     | customer_count | percentage |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| pro monthly   | 326            | 32.6       |
| churn         | 236            | 23.6       |
| basic monthly | 224            | 22.4       |
| pro annual    | 195            | 19.5       |
| trial         | 19             | 1.9        |

---

### 8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?

```sql
WITH previous_plan AS (
    SELECT *,
           LAG(plan_id, 1) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS prev_plan_id
    FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions s JOIN foodie_fi.plans p USING(plan_id)
)
SELECT count(customer_id) as customer_count
FROM   previous_plan
WHERE  prev_plan_id<3 and plan_id=3 and EXTRACT(YEAR from start_date) = 2020


-- a much more simpler approach:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as customer_count
FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE  plan_id = 3 and EXTRACT(YEAR from start_date) = 2020
```

#### Result set:

| customer_count |
| -------------- |
| 195            |

---

### 9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?

```sql
WITH trial_plan_cte as (
    SELECT *
    FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions JOIN foodie_fi.plans USING (plan_id)
    WHERE  plan_id=0),
annual_plan_cte as (
    SELECT *
    FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions JOIN foodie_fi.plans USING (plan_id)
    WHERE  plan_id=3)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(apc.start_date - tpc.start_date))AS avg_conversion_days
FROM   trial_plan_cte tpc JOIN annual_plan_cte apc USING (customer_id)
```

#### Result set:

| avg_conversion_days |
| ------------------- |
| 105                 |

---

### 10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)

```sql
WITH trial_plan_cte AS (
    SELECT customer_id, start_date AS trial_start_date
    FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions
    WHERE  plan_id = 0
),
annual_plan_cte AS (
    SELECT customer_id, start_date AS annual_start_date
    FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions
    WHERE  plan_id = 3
),
conversion_times AS (
    SELECT  tpc.customer_id,
            tpc.trial_start_date,
            apc.annual_start_date,
            (apc.annual_start_date - tpc.trial_start_date) AS days_to_convert
    FROM    trial_plan_cte tpc JOIN annual_plan_cte apc USING(customer_id)
)
SELECT    CASE
             WHEN days_to_convert <= 30 THEN '0-30 days'
             WHEN days_to_convert > 30 AND days_to_convert <= 60 THEN '31-60 days'
             WHEN days_to_convert > 60 AND days_to_convert <= 90 THEN '61-90 days'
             WHEN days_to_convert > 90 AND days_to_convert <= 120 THEN '91-120 days'
           ELSE 'Over 120 days'
         END AS conversion_period,
         COUNT(*) AS customer_count,
         ROUND(AVG(days_to_convert), 0) AS avg_conversion_days
FROM     conversion_times
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY MIN(days_to_convert);
```

working of `WIDTH_BUCKET` : [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50518548/creating-a-bin-column-in-postgres-to-check-an-integer-and-return-a-string)

```sql
-- another approach: using WIDTH_BUCKET() function in PostgreSQL.


WITH trial_plan_cte AS (
    SELECT customer_id, start_date AS trial_start_date
    FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions
    WHERE  plan_id = 0
),
annual_plan_cte AS (
    SELECT customer_id, start_date AS annual_start_date
    FROM   foodie_fi.subscriptions
    WHERE  plan_id = 3
),
conversion_times AS (
    SELECT
        tpc.customer_id,
        tpc.trial_start_date,
        apc.annual_start_date,
        (apc.annual_start_date - tpc.trial_start_date) AS days_to_convert
    FROM trial_plan_cte tpc
    JOIN annual_plan_cte apc ON tpc.customer_id = apc.customer_id
),
conversion_buckets AS (
    SELECT
        days_to_convert,
        WIDTH_BUCKET(days_to_convert, 0, 120, 4) AS conversion_bucket
    FROM conversion_times
)
SELECT   conversion_bucket,
         COUNT(*) AS customer_count,
         ROUND(AVG(days_to_convert), 0) AS avg_conversion_days
FROM     conversion_buckets
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:

| conversion_period | customer_count | avg_conversion_days |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| 0-30 days         | 49             | 10                  |
| 31-60 days        | 24             | 42                  |
| 61-90 days        | 34             | 71                  |
| 91-120 days       | 35             | 101                 |
| Over 120 days     | 116            | 168                 |
