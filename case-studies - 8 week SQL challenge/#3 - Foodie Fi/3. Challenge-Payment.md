## Case Study Questions - Challenge Payment Question

The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new `payments` table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the `subscriptions` table with the following requirements:

1. monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original `start_date` of any monthly paid plan

2. upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately

3. upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period

4. once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

## Solution:

Let's collaborate on running the queries using PostgreSQL on [Challenge Payment - DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/n8rbeHWhqpvrN3mb9NCDBD/16). It'll be fantastic to team up and tackle the questions together!!

###

Creating the `Payments` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE payments (
    customer_id INTEGER,
    plan_id INTEGER,
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(5,2)
)
```

Insert data into the `Payments` table based on the requirements:

```sql
INSERT INTO payments (customer_id, plan_id, start_date, end_date, amount)

-- query implementing requirements to be inserted

```

getting the result set from `Payments` table :

```sql
SELECT   *
FROM     payments
ORDER BY plan_id, customer_id
```
