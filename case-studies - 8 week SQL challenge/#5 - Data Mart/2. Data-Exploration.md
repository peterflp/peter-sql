## Case Study Questions - Data Exploration


1. What day of the week is used for each `week_date` value?

2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?

3. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?

4. What is the total sales for each region for each month?

5. What is the total count of transactions for each platform

6. What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?

7. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?

8. Which `age_band` and `demographic` values contribute the most to Retail sales?

9. Can we use the `avg_transaction` column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?

## Solutions :

Let's collaborate on running the queries using PostgreSQL on [Data Exploration - DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/6hNYczHWLCrhKfFD8ij5St/17).

### 1. What day of the week is used for each `week_date` value?


```sql
SELECT TO_CHAR(week_date, 'Day') AS day_of_week
FROM   weekly_sales_cleaned
```

#### Result set:

*returning only first 5 entries*

day_of_week |
--|
Wednesday |
Wednesday |
Wednesday |
Wednesday |
Wednesday |

---

### 2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?

```sql
WITH all_weeks AS (
  SELECT generate_series(1, 52) AS week_number
),
present_weeks AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT week_number
  FROM   weekly_sales_cleaned
)
SELECT CONCAT(CAST(aw.week_number AS VARCHAR), ', ') AS missing_weeks
FROM   all_weeks aw LEFT JOIN present_weeks pw USING(week_number)
WHERE  pw.week_number IS NULL;


-- concat the missing weeks as result set getting too large to display.
```

#### Result set:

missing_weeks | 
--|
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 31, 32, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 | 

---

### 3. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?


```sql
SELECT   calendar_year, SUM(transactions) as total_transactions
FROM     weekly_sales_cleaned
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1  
```

#### Result set:

calendar_year |	total_transactions |
--|--|
18 |	346406460 |
19 |	365639285 |
20 |	375813651 |

---

### 4. What is the total sales for each region for each month?


```sql
SELECT   region, month_number, SUM(sales) as total_transactions
FROM     weekly_sales_cleaned
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2
```

#### Result set:

*returning only first 4 entries*


region |	month_number |	total_transactions |
--|--|--|
AFRICA |	3 |	567767480 |
AFRICA |	4 |	1911783504 |
AFRICA |	5 |	1647244738 |
AFRICA |	6 |	1767559760 |

---

### 5. What is the total count of transactions for each platform


```sql
SELECT   platform, COUNT(transactions) as transaction_count
FROM     weekly_sales_cleaned
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:


platform |	transaction_count |
--|--|
Retail |	8568 |
Shopify |	8549 |

---

### 6. What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?


```sql
WITH monthly_sales AS (
  SELECT month_number,
         CASE WHEN platform = 'Retail' THEN sales ELSE 0 END AS retail_sales,
    	 CASE WHEN platform = 'Shopify' THEN sales ELSE 0 END AS shopify_sales
  FROM   weekly_sales_cleaned
)
SELECT   month_number,
  		 ROUND(SUM(retail_sales) * 100.0 / (SUM(retail_sales) + SUM(shopify_sales)), 2) AS retail_pct,
  		 ROUND(SUM(shopify_sales) * 100.0 / (SUM(retail_sales) + SUM(shopify_sales)), 2) AS shopify_pct
FROM     monthly_sales
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

#### Result set:

month_number |	retail_pct |	shopify_pct |
--|--|--|
3 |	97.54 |	2.46 |
4 |	97.59 |	2.41 |
5 |	97.30 |	2.70 |
6 |	97.27 |	2.73 |
7 |	97.29 |	2.71 |
8 |	97.08 |	2.92 |
9 |	97.38 |	2.62 |

### 7. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?

```sql
WITH annual_sales AS (
  SELECT   calendar_year,
           demographic,
           SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM     weekly_sales_cleaned
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT   calendar_year,
         demographic,
         ROUND(total_sales * 100.0 / 
            (SELECT SUM(total_sales) 
             FROM   annual_sales 
             WHERE  calendar_year = as1.calendar_year), 2) AS sales_pct
FROM     annual_sales as as1
ORDER BY 1, 3 DESC;
```

#### Result set:

calendar_year |	demographic |	sales_pct |
--|--|--|
18 |	unknown |	41.63 |
18 |	Families |	31.99 |
18 |	Couples |	26.38 |
19 |	unknown |	40.25 |
19 |	Families |	32.47 |
19 |	Couples |	27.28 |
20 |	unknown |	38.55 |
20 |	Families |	32.73 |
20 |	Couples |	28.72 |

### 8. Which `age_band` and `demographic` values contribute the most to Retail sales?


```sql
SELECT   age_band, 
         demographic, 
         SUM(sales) AS retail_sales,
         ROUND(100 * SUM(sales)::NUMERIC / SUM(SUM(sales)) OVER (), 1) AS contribution_percentage
FROM     clean_weekly_sales
WHERE    platform = 'Retail'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;


-- WITH retail_sales AS (
--   SELECT   age_band,
--            demographic,
--            SUM(CASE WHEN platform = 'Retail' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS retail_sales
--   FROM     weekly_sales_cleaned
--   GROUP BY 1, 2
-- )
-- SELECT   age_band,
--          demographic,
--          retail_sales,
--          ROUND(retail_sales * 100.0 / (SELECT SUM(retail_sales) FROM retail_sales), 2) AS contribution_percentage
-- FROM     retail_sales
-- ORDER BY 4 DESC;
```

#### Result set:

age_band |	demographic |	retail_sales |	contribution_percentage |
--|--|--|--|
unknown |	unknown |	16067285533 |	40.52 |
unknown |	Families |	12759667763 |	32.18 |
unknown |	Couples |	10827663141 |	27.30 |

### 9. Can we use the `avg_transaction` column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?

```sql
SELECT   calendar_year,
         CASE WHEN platform = 'Retail' THEN 'Retail' ELSE 'Shopify' END AS platform,
         SUM(sales) / SUM(transactions) AS avg_transaction_size
FROM     weekly_sales_cleaned
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2
```

#### Result set:


calendar_year |	platform |	avg_transaction_size |
--|--|--|
18 |	Retail |	36 |
18 |	Shopify |	192 |
19 |	Retail |	36 |
19 |	Shopify |	183 |
20 |	Retail |	36 |
20 |	Shopify |	179 |
