### 


```sql
WITH before_after as (
  SELECT   region,
           platform,
           age_band,
           demographic,
           customer_type,
           week_date,
           SUM(sales) as total_sales,
           CASE WHEN week_number < 25 THEN 'Before' ELSE 'After' END as time_period
  FROM     weekly_sales_cleaned
  WHERE    week_number BETWEEN 13 and 36 and calendar_year = '20'
  GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, week_number
  ORDER BY 1, 2
)
SELECT   region,
         platform,
         age_band,
         demographic,
         customer_type,
         SUM(CASE WHEN time_period = 'Before' THEN total_sales END) as before_sales,
         SUM(CASE WHEN time_period = 'After' THEN total_sales END) as after_sales,
         ROUND(
                (SUM(CASE WHEN time_period = 'After' THEN total_sales END) - 
                SUM(CASE WHEN time_period = 'Before' THEN total_sales END)), 2) as sales_change,
         ROUND(100.0 * 
                (SUM(CASE WHEN time_period = 'After' THEN total_sales END) - 
                SUM(CASE WHEN time_period = 'Before' THEN total_sales END)) / 
                SUM(CASE WHEN time_period = 'Before' THEN total_sales END), 2) as pct_change
FROM     before_after
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
ORDER BY pct_change
LIMIT    5
```

#### Result set:

region |	platform |	age_band |	demographic |	customer_type |	before_sales |	after_sales |	sales_change |	pct_change |

Here are some recommendations for Danny's team at Data Mart based on the analysis:

1. **Focus on the underperforming areas**: 

    - The data shows that sales in South America, especially on the Shopify platform, had the biggest decline. 
    
    - The team should investigate why this region and platform performed so poorly and develop strategies to address the issues.


2. **Understand the impact on different customer types**: 

    - The analysis indicates that new customers on the Shopify platform in Europe and existing customers on the Retail platform in Oceania saw significant sales drops. 

    - The team should look into how the sales performance differed for new versus existing customers and adjust their approach accordingly.


3. **Dig deeper into demographic and age trends**: 

    - The unknown age and demographic segments seemed to be hit the hardest across multiple regions and platforms. 
    
    - The team should try to better understand these customer groups and what factors contributed to the sales declines.


4. **Collaborate across the company**: 

    The different teams (sales, marketing, product, operations) should work together to fully understand the problems and develop solutions. This cross-functional approach can provide more comprehensive insights.


5. **Continuously monitor performance**: 

    Implementing a system to closely track sales metrics across all areas will allow the team to quickly identify and respond to emerging trends. They should be ready to test and refine their interventions as needed.


6. **Explore new opportunities**: 

    While addressing the current challenges, the team should also look for ways to diversify the business, such as expanding to new markets or adding new products. This can help make the company more resilient in the long run.


Overall, the key is for Danny's team to thoroughly investigate the problem areas, collaborate internally, and be agile in their response. By taking these steps, they can navigate the current difficulties and position Data Mart for future success.
